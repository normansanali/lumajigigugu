On Sunday, April 26, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">High School Musical</a>&nbsp;alum took to Instagram with yet another video of herself sining along to a throwback tune from the classic film series that launched her career. This time, the 31-year-old opted for a song from the first film, “Breaking Free.”</p><p>“Car-eoke,” she captioned the clip, which was filmed in her car. “To… yep… ‘Breaking Free. Lol.”</p><p>As fans know, this came one week after the brunette beauty stunned with an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">epic rendition of “Gotta Go My Own Way”</a> from&nbsp;<i>High School&nbsp;Musical 2</i>. On April 19, she teamed up with&nbsp;BFF <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Max Clayton</strong></a>&nbsp;to belt out the emotional track and it’s official, years later, that song definitely still hits the same way! At the time, Vanessa also revealed that she’s on an “HSM kick” at the moment, and now, it seems like this she’s still in her feels about the trilogy. Can someone say relatable?!</p><p>Prior to her Instagram videos,&nbsp;the actress&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reunited</a> with her fellow&nbsp;High School Musical&nbsp;castmates to perform “We’re All In This Together” during “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Disney’s Family Singalong</a>” concert. For those who missed it, fans were in for a real treat when Vanessa,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Ashley Tisdale</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Corbin Bleu</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Monique Coleman</strong></a>,<a href=#><strong>&nbsp;Lucas Grabeel</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Zac Efron</strong></a> all teamed up for the television event,&nbsp;and boy, was it epic seeing them all together again. But some people were not happy when they noticed that Zac didn’t participate in the song. Instead, he sent in a video message recorded on his phone that was used to introduce the cast.</p><p>Why didn’t he belt out the lines of the epic throwback song <a href=#>with the rest of his castmates</a>? Well, some fans have speculated that he didn’t participate in the musical aspect of the event because he actually never sang the song in the first place. Yep, for those who didn’t know, <a href=#><strong>Drew Seeley</strong></a> actually sang Zac’s lines in the first HSM movie. Others have suggested Zac’s absence from the musical number was because it was hard for the creators to get in contact with him. Some have theorized that <a href=#>his rocky past with ex-girlfriend Vanessa</a> may have contributed to his absence.</p><p>For those who forgot, they dated for five magical years, but when they called it quits in 2010, they didn’t end things on great terms. And in 2017, Vanessa revealed they are no longer on speaking terms.</p><p>“I completely lost contact with him,” she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>.</p><p>The actress also revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>&nbsp;in January 2020 that she hadn’t “seen Zac or spoken to him in years.”</p><p>Love J-14?
