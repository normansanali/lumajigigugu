He asked if I lived there because I ‘look suspicious.’ I showed my keys and buzzed myself into my building. He left, no apology.’</p><p>She went on to point out why this was so much more than a simple misunderstanding: ‘This is the reality of all black girls: ‘One day you are called an icon, the next day, a threat. In a sense, he was right. I AM A THREAT: to injustice, to inequality, ignorance. Anyone who speaks the truth and then walks with hope is an obvious danger to the powers that be.’</p><p>The 22 year old icon received a lot of support from fans as well as celebrities.</p><p>Lily Collins, for instance, commented: ‘Keep being the constant light you are.’</p><p>Annasophia Robb wrote: ‘Who is this mf?! I wanna track him dowwwwwn!’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Yamiche Alcindor, PBS White House correspondent also commented that: ‘Amanda Gorman’s experience is that of so many black people. Happy she made it home safely. So many others don’t.’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRoq6vsMBmnqiqnZa7brPErapmnp%2BhubDDxJ1koaedmnqjxYymmKdlk6GuqrnIp55mq5iaeq27zqSqZqulqL2qr8iorKxlo52ybr%2FAsqpmrJiewG610maroZ1dp7KiuMitsGanlmKvra3CpGSgoaKhwG6Al2lna2tf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
