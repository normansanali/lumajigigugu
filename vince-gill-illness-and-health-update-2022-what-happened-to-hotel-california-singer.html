Due to a health issue, the singer could not attend the CMA Awards.</p><p>Currently, Vine is in excellent health and hasn’t experienced any problems.</p><p>On the red carpet of the 52nd Annual CMA Awards, country stars Brothers Osborne spoke candidly to Kellie Pickler and Ben Aaron about how the performance schedule had shifted – and they revealed that Vince Gill was in the hospital and unable to perform.</p><p>Likewise, Jenny Gill, Gill’s talented daughter, has opened up about her father’s condition on Instagram, revealing that he is still in the hospital.</p><p>She said that her father had a kidney stone and was still in the hospital awaiting surgery.

She was taken to the nearest medical facilities in an emergency. Fortunately, Grant wore a helmet, which kept her from serious injuries. Despite this, she was wounded all over her body.</p><p>Grant’s condition is stable, but she is being kept in the hospital as a precaution. Her family has not yet provided information about her current situation.</p><p>The singer had only tweeted about a book titled Chase The Fun eight hours before. The book she was reading teaches people how to have fun and enjoy life. It invites you to spend 100 delightful days learning and having fun right where you are.</p><p>Perhaps Grant was enthralled by the book, and she tried bicycling for the first time, which did not go well. Previously, Grant also had open heart surgery in 2020 to treat a congenital abnormality that impairs blood flow between the heart and the lungs.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=vince-gills-net-worth-comparison-with-wife-amy-grant></span>Vince Gill’s Net Worth Comparison With Wife Amy Grant<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>American country music performer Vince Gill has a&nbsp;30 million dollar&nbsp;net worth.
