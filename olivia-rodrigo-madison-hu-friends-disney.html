Though Madison has gone on to other projects recently, including a film alongside Lily-Rose Depp, she hasn't forgotten her Disney friend.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Critics Say This Lily-Rose Depp Film Was Just 'Meh'</a></span></p><p>Her earlier Instagram pics reflect plenty of chill-and-BFF time while on set of 'Bizaardvark.' But even her recent posts reflect that Madison's still close with Olivia, at least.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her older Instagram photos may be more 'promotional' in nature -- after all, what's better than living a life similar to that of one's character to help boost ratings and viewership?</p><p>But the girls seem to have an authentic connection, and the lack of headlines about a feud, in the way of other Disney spats, is an indicator that all is well in the 'Bizaardvark' circle. After all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Rodrigo and Sabrina Carpenter's 'feud'</a> wasn't the only one to come from the Disney Channel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Which is interesting, especially since Olivia is reported to have dated not just her 'HSM' co-star, but also another former co-star that she shared with Madison...</p><h2 id=did-olivia-rodrigo-go-out-with-jake-paul>Did Olivia Rodrigo Go Out With Jake Paul?</h2><p>A lot of fans believe that Olivia Rodrigo paired up with the now-famous Jake Paul on 'Bizaardvark,' but that apparently isn't true. Before she hit the fame lottery with 'Drivers License' and 'High School Musical: The Musical: The Series,' Olivia did spend a lot of time on set with Jake.</p><p>But sources say that before Joshua Bassett, Olivia's much-publicized ex (everyone seems to agree that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Drivers License' is about her breakup from him</a>) she swooned over someone else on TV.</p><p>Republic World says that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia dated her 'Bizaardvark' co-star</a>&nbsp;Ethan Wacker from somewhere around 2016 until 2019 -- the same year she was said to have started dating Bassett.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Either way, it doesn't seem like her on-set relationships had anything to do with her friendship with Madison. The two former co-stars may even wind up in another Disney special together, which would be amazing and probably just as hilarious as 'Bizaardvark.'</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Say This Is The Most Underrated Disney Star Ever</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimpaGmnq5uvs6dqaKfn2K6orDIrKanZZiqeqe%2ByJ6lnatdmba0usSyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
