And so beautiful and soul bearing and we all got to see another side of you that you don't always let us see, and we appreciate that. And all us artists adore you. You are our light. And the way that you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel is empowering, and you make them stand up for themselves. And I love you. I always have. And I always will. Grammys, I appreciate it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Adele cried on stage, a teary-eye Beyoncé began to cry from the front row, mouthing "I love you" to the 25 singer.
