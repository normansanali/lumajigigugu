I know the conservatorship is about to be over but I still want justice !!! I'm only 5'4" and I've played the bigger person my entire life ... do you know how hard that is ??" We have a feeling this is just the beginning of Britney's confessions about her conservatorship and family life.</p><p dir=ltr>While Britney's older brother, Bryan Spears, has not seen his name in the headlines as much as the rest of the family, <a href=#>Page Six</a> reported that Jamie Lynn was supposedly forced to change <a href=#>the title of her upcoming memoir</a> because of the criticism she received from her sister's fans. She used the working title "I Must Confess," which as many fans can recall is a line from Britney's breakout hit "... Baby One More Time." This came after Britney called out Jamie Lynn for performing a remix of her songs — apparently without her blessing — back in 2017. As the fallout from her conservatorship continues, we wish Britney peace with her new life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2xjaoB4e8GroK2mla56tLzEmqmsZZ2WuKa%2FjKGcq2WWmrKttc2gqmaZkqTCtXnHnqlmnpGitq3FjJyjnpmiZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
