The artist talks about missing his ex-girlfriend and wanting to get back together with her. He also mentions a girl he sees at the bus stop who reminds him of his former lover. He wonders about what happened to her and if she also misses him. The song also has sexual undertones with lyrics about being with more than one woman and possibly having a threesome.</p><br><p>Don Toliver uses repetition in the chorus with the line “Oh yeah like she go low.” This repetition adds emphasis to the feelings and emotions that the artist is describing. Furthermore, the chorus establishes a hypnotic rhythm and helps convey the melancholic mood of the song. The line “Most of the room didn't make it, the kid was like” can refer to a party that didn't end well. The “kid” in the line may refer to Don Toliver himself, who may have been affected by the fallout of the party.</p><br><p>In conclusion, Bus Stop is a song that talks about pain, heartbreak, and sexual relationships. The lyrics are layered with complex emotions and keeps listeners intrigued. Like many of Don Toliver's songs, Bus Stop has a unique style and sound that has helped him build a dedicated fan base.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>By the bus stop</u><br>The location where the events described in the song took place.</p><br><p><u>Most of the room didn't make it, the kid was like</u><br>Many people didn't survive, and one survivor felt a certain way.</p><br><p><u>In my different bag oh God I want my baby back</u><br>An expression of longing and desire for someone he lost.</p><br><p><u>What about the girl in the drop top, top, top, top, top, top, top, top, top, top</u><br>A question about a particular girl who was seen in a convertible car.</p><br><p><u>Okay, what about the girl in the drop top, with the lollipop at the light, by the bus stop</u><br>A more specific query about a girl in a convertible car and a lollipop, who could be seen at the bus stop.</p><br><p><u>Oh, yeah like she go low</u><br>A suggestive phrase about a girl's behavior.</p><br><p><u>Fuck the love, to you know it's when we met</u><br>An expression of disregard for love in the context of when they first met.</p><br><p><u>Don't be afraid, I guess I'll be right there</u><br>An offer of support and reassurance.</p><br><p><u>I need you to do this when I say</u><br>A request for obedience and compliance.</p><br><p><u>Not what it was destined, I can be your best friend</u><br>A statement of accepting what wasn't meant to be, but still being a good friend to the other person.</p><br><p><u>And I guess you love to fall</u><br>An observation that the other person seems to enjoy falling in love.</p><br><p><u>Since you came back, I am not involved</u><br>A statement that there is no longer a romantic involvement between them.</p><br><p><u>She said "do you still love me?", I said "not at all"</u><br>A conversation that took place about the end of their romantic relationship.</p><br><p><u>Please don't wait, I won't be here long</u><br>A request to not wait long because the singer will not be around for much longer.</p><br><p><u>I need you to, and I want you to, fall in love with no issues</u><br>A desire for the other person to fall in love without any problems.</p><br><p><u>Yeah, I did you wrong, but I miss you</u><br>An acknowledgement of having done wrong to the other person, but still missing them.</p><br><p><u>It's not my fault, it's some you knew</u><br>A statement that what occurred was not entirely the artist's fault, as the other person knew what they were getting into.</p><br><p><u>Fuck a winner now (oh, yeah she go low)</u><br>A crude expression about sleeping with someone, accompanied by a suggestive phrase.</p><br><p><u>Bitches ain't new, I say anything cool</u><br>A statement that women are not new to him and he doesn't have to try hard to impress them.</p><br><p><u>It ain't a thing to me, show me with your friend</u><br>An expression of being unbothered and a request to see the other person's friend.</p><br><p><u>She don't gotta be your enemy</u><br>A statement that the other person's friend doesn't have to be their enemy.</p><br><p><u>This ain't my first time on the road, I got not a cold</u><br>An acknowledgement of having experience in relationships and not being affected by them.</p><br><p><u>It's two of y'all and one of me, let's make it three</u><br>A suggestion that the two of them and one other person should engage in a sexual encounter.</p><br><p><u>In the winter, suicide</u><br>A cryptic phrase with no clear meaning in the context of the song.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © BMG Rights Management, Universal Music Publishing Group, CONCORD MUSIC PUBLISHING LLC, Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd.<br>Written by: Caleb Toliver, Chauncey A.
