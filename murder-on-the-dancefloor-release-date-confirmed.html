The resulting film is a masterclass of satire and shock, all culminating in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">viral ending scene</a>.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>Having achieved everything he wanted, Oliver dances around the house nude to Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s song, “Murder on the Dance Floor.” The song became a sensation, even though it was not a new release. The music in Saltburn is period-accurate of the time, including the pop sensation. Ellis-Bextor’s 2001 hit was released two decades before Saltburn came out but, because of its success, has seen a new wave of popularity.</p><h2 id=h-when-does-murder-on-the-dance-floor-release-on-vinyl data-injectable=false>When does ‘Murder On the Dance Floor’ release on vinyl?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=797 data-injectable=true>It isn’t outrageous to conclude that Ellis-Bextor’s song is the most celebrated part of the film. Not as controversial as the grave or bathtub scenes, Oliver’s dance to the song wraps up Saltburn in the only way it could. The scene – accompanied by the rest of the film’s most talked about moments – has given rise to the popularity of the song, which was initially released in 2001. It debuted on the artist’s album, “Read My Lips,” and rose on the UK singles chart.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Now, for the first time, “Murder On the Dance Floor” will be released on vinyl on Feb. 16, 2024. According to <a href=#>NME</a>, the song will be available on a red 7-inch vinyl, distributed by Polydor/Universal. For those inclined, the song will also be available on all regular streaming services. You too can pull an Oliver at the end of the film – at least in the privacy of your own home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46mrKuclad6sLqMrZ%2BeZZSWu6SxxaWmqKpdp7KtscCsnGackamybq%2FOp52iqp2asXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
