But then, I quite like being scared. I’ve lived under a structure of school terms for a long time. Now I have this open landscape which I haven’t had since I was 22. Separating is really hard, but it’s really important.”</p><p id=eFEysAeCWuMd data-wc=99>Lily celebrated her 18th birthday in February and her mum uploaded a throwback photo on Instagram, showing Lily as a little toddler wearing her mother's shoes. Alongside the image, Kate shared a sweet message for her only child. "18 and now you're in the big girl shoes for real," she wrote. "I love you so much @lily_beckinsale. Nothing has been better in my life than being your mama. Happy happy happy birthday to my favourite, funniest best person in the world. PS we will obviously get you better shoes, those are hideous I don't know what I was thinking."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnxzfJBwZ3FqYGl%2BeIGVaKKarJVir6avyqKlrJmcmnqlrdSgn62domK5qrjYZqOop5uWuaq3xGaZoqOZo7ZuvMeoq6hn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
