Four years ago, I decided I wanted to have a child. I wanted to do it on my own terms,” the actress told her Instagram followers at the time. “I now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way. I hope we arrive at a point in which it’s normalized to not want a ring in order to have a crib. A part of me wants to uphold that my private life is none of anyone’s business. I also get that the nature of my job compels me to take control of this. My daughter was born on April 8, 2021. Her name is Oonagh Paige Heard. She’s the beginning of the rest of my life.”</p><p>The Texas native has<a href=#> given rare glimpses of life with her baby girl</a> ever since, including sweet Instagram shots of herself exercising and working with the little one.</p><p>As for Tisdale, the High School Musical star <a href=#>gave birth</a> to her and husband<strong> Christopher French</strong>’s daughter in March 2021, naming the newborn <a href=#>Jupiter</a>.</p><p>“She was named before I was even pregnant,” the New Jersey native said during a <a href=#>Good Morning America</a> appearance two months later. “Basically, I just came up with her name a year and a half before I got pregnant. I am someone who, like, even with my animals, I name them before I get them. I said to my husband, ‘Do you to like it?’ and he was like, ‘Yeah, that is so cool,’ especially because he’s got such a great last name. And then once we found out she was a girl, Chris named her middle name Iris.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Suite Life of Zack and Cody alum noted that the moniker was inspired by a song her mom, <strong>Lisa Morris</strong>, sang when she was little putting Tisdale’s tights on. “It’s like, ‘Hands up! Reach for the stars, there goes Jupiter, there goes Mars,’” the former Disney Channel star explained. “And I thought, ‘Jupiter is such a great name!'”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see more celebrity parents who chose unique names for their infants, from<a href=#><strong> Kim Kardashian</strong></a> and daughter <a href=#>North</a> to<a href=#> <strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a> and son Tennessee.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkxKa10Z2crKxdmLKtscGroK2xXZeuo8WMp5imnaNif3F9kGpscGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
