According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful Select</a>, Lynch's contract is set to expire in 2024, alongside Drew McIntyre and Sheamus. While the belief is that Lynch and WWE will work things out, with recent releases and Lynch being a mother, it's hard to tell at this point where the two sides sit on a new extension.</p><p>Lynch is undeniably one of the biggest stars in WWE. Her journey to superstardom culminated with a punch in the face by the recently returning Nia Jax and led to a huge spotlight match at WrestleMania 35, where she defeated Charlotte Flair and Ronda Rousey in a historic main event to capture the Raw and SmackDown women's titles. She's taken time away to have a baby, but now that she's back, she's proven, once again, that she's a draw, with her recent presence significantly boosting ratings for NXT during her prominent appearances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/whatsapp-image-2023-08-10-at-11-34-16.jpeg><p>While it seems inconceivable that Lynch would depart from WWE, the key question remains the nature of her contract negotiations. The extent of the financial gap between Lynch's expectations and WWE's offer, as well as the overall relationship between the two parties, will be crucial factors. If she believes she's worth a certain amount and WWE is only looking to go so high, especially in light of their recent merger and company roster cuts, that negotiation process could be fascinating.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Seth Rollins & Becky Lynch's WWE Team-Up Was A Disaster, Explained</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>WWE has been in the middle of contract rumors before. Drew McIntyre was absent for some time and while he hinted the rumors were often not accurate, reports are he still doesn't have a new contract signed a ready to go. If Lynch holds out or WWE tries to drive a hard bargain, The Man could conceivable take some time away to spend with her daughter. It's an intriguing time for her to be coming up on a renewal. WWE is making record revenue, but also potentially watching what they spend.</p><h2 id=hopefully-contract-talks-go-smoothly>Hopefully Contract Talks Go Smoothly</h2><p>Becky Lynch's journey to becoming one of WWE's biggest stars is a testament to her undeniable talent and the connection she has forged with fans. It would a shame if the two sides couldn't come to some sort of understanding.</p><p>As contract talks unfold, many within the wrestling community echo the sentiment: "Pay The Man." She's earned whatever she's got coming in terms of a new deal and WWE will surely miss her if she's not around.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeSmrCsxYylsKebmGKwsLrTq5icrF2nsrG70a2cnaSpYrKvsMinnmahnmJ%2FcX6TaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
