If they are, they aren’t much of a breakup. Any time I’m trying to find that groove on a big tempo song, I go back and listen to some Aerosmith records. ‘Love in an Elevator,’ ‘Rag Doll,’ all that stuff was really great music.</p><p>It’s something that I still dig and go back and listen to. Your family is people you lean on and learn from. When I told my family I wanted to do music, they were really supportive. If you aren’t already a songwriter, try it.</p><p>When you can say what you want to say, in your own words, it’s incredibly easy to show an audience who you are. I’m a sucker for a sad song. Chris Young Sad, Song, We didn’t have a whole lot of cash growing up. My mom was a single parent for a while before my stepdad came into the picture.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-919 data-method=placement-service></span><p>If you aren’t already a songwriter, try it. When you can say what you want to say, in your own words, it’s incredibly easy to show an audience who you are. My standing gig in college was playing the El Chico patio on Murfreesboro Road. I got $100, tips, and free quesadillas.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_16"></span><p>I grew up loving Vince Gill. That guy sounds just like his record – or better than his record. I’ve always been such a fan. The only piece of advice I’ve ever given anybody is to learn to write songs and write as many songs as you can.</p><p>Because it’s never gonna hurt, and when you run into that problem of, ‘God, I don’t know what I want to say,’ or the opposite problem of, ‘I know exactly what I want to say, but no one has written it,’ then you can just go write it yourself.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span><p><span>Some of my favorite records growing up were Christmas albums. The ones I liked best were the albums that you could listen to from start to finish. You could put them on while you’re decorating the tree or driving around looking at Christmas lights.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-920 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><p><span>Everybody has their favorite sad songs. That’s part of what I love so much about country music. Country music is never afraid to go with a sad song. Everybody influences everybody else, in my opinion. There are different trends in music all the time.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_12"></span><p><span>No matter who starts them, if it’s a true trend in the music, it ends up influencing other people as well. Everybody’s like, ‘You’re tall. You didn’t play basketball?’ They asked me when I was a freshman in high school, and basketball practice was the same time a lot of stuff happened with the choir.</span></p><p><span>And I picked choir, which, normally, people would scratch their heads at, but it worked out okay. In my opinion, that’s one of the hardest things to do in songwriting: crafting a song that speaks to you but, at its core, is a simple concept.</span></p><p><span>I think the biggest way of connecting with people is through your music and kind of saying what you want to say as an artist. And hopefully, you’re making something that someone’s going to be like, ‘This is my favorite song.’</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-921 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span><p><span>That’s always your goal, I think, anybody in any genre. I’m really loud. I can’t sing softly. There’s probably a couple of someones that are gonna hear the songs and go, ‘I think that might have been about me,’ or, ‘I know it’s about me.’</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span><p><span>I do play that pretty close to the vest. I don’t think I’m ever gonna write a song and drop somebody’s name in it. Social media is a very, very powerful tool. It also gives power to tools. I go home, and there’s dust on everything because I’m never there.</span></p><p><span>If you were to ask me when I was 17 if I was mad because I didn’t have a deal, I would have probably said, ‘Yeah.’ Now I’m so glad I got it when I got it. People tell you to be patient and wait.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span><p><span>Patience is not a virtue of mine, but I think everything definitely happened the right way for me. My family and I are very close, and they mean more than anything to me, but I’m also the kind of guy who likes to go out with my friends and have a good time on Friday nights.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-922 data-method=placement-service></span><p><span>Chris Young Songs</span></p><p><span>Lonely Eyes A.M. · </span><strong>2013</strong></p><p><span>Who I Am with You A.M. · </span><strong>2013</strong></p><p><span>Sober Saturday Night I’m Comin’ Over · </span><strong>2015</strong></p><p><span>Drinkin’ Me Lonely Chris Young · </span><strong>2006</strong></p><p><span>I Can Take It From There Neon · </span><strong>2011</strong></p><p><span>You Neon · </span><strong>2011</strong></p><p><span>Neon · </span><strong>2011</strong></p><p><span>Where I Go When I Drink Losing Sleep · </span><strong>2017</strong></p><p><span>Voices The Man I Want to Be · </span><strong>2009</strong></p><p><span>She’s Got a Way Losing Sleep · </span><strong>2017</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_19"></span><p><span>She’s Got This Thing About Her Neon · </span><strong>2011</strong></p><p><span>I Know a Guy I’m Comin’ Over · </span><strong>2015</strong></p><p><span>Raised on Country </span><strong>2019</strong></p><p><span>Blacked Out Losing Sleep · </span><strong>2017</strong></p><p><span>Leave Me Wanting More Losing Sleep · </span><strong>2017</strong></p><p><span>Chris Young&nbsp; Albums</span></p><p><span>Losing sleep </span><strong>2017</strong></p><p><span>I’m Comin Over </span><strong>2015</strong></p><p><span>It Must Chrismas </span><strong>2016</strong></p><p><span>Neon </span><strong>2011</strong></p><p><span>The Man I Want to Be </span><strong>2009</strong></p><p><span>A.M </span><strong>2013</strong></p><p><span>Chris Young </span><strong>2010</strong></p><p><span>Country Strong </span><strong>2010</strong></p><p><span>The Holy field </span><strong>2014</strong></p><p><span>Volunteer Jam XX: A.T </span><strong>2018</strong></p><p><span>Pure Country Stars </span><strong>2010</strong></p><p><span>Rising the Remixes </span><strong>2010</strong></p><p><span>Chris Young Quotes</span></p><ul><li>I don’t think breakups are ever easy for anybody.
