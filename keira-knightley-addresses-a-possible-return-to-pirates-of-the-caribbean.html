She sailed away in brilliant style,” Knightley told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET</a>. While the British actress’ comment speaks for itself on her intentions to come back to the franchise, that’s not exactly a true statement about her character’s final arc.</p><p data-characters=601 data-current-count=902 data-injectable=true>The last we saw of the aristocrat turned Pirate King, she was finally reunited with her husband Will, played by Orlando Bloom, after the curse that bound him to a ghost ship was broken by the couple’s son. Their very last scene, which aired after the credits rolled on Dead Men Tell No Tales, showed Elizabeth and Will sound asleep in their Jamaican home, as an intimidating shadow crept up on them. The last shot of a couple of barnacles lying on a puddle of water on the floor seemed to tease the return of one of the most iconic villains in the Pirates series, Bill Nighy’s Davy Jones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Pirares-of-the-Caribbean-Dead-Men-Tell-No-Tales.jpg><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>If Jones did come back to haunt Will, and Disney decided to go with that storyline for a possible forthcoming film, then surely Elizabeth would play a big part in it. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Regardless, the project is not yet a certainty</a>. The last we heard about it, producer Jerry Bruckheimer said there were two scrips in the works.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>“We have a very good script. We developed two of them — the one with Margot Robbie and one with a younger cast. The Margot Robbie one needs a little more work. The younger cast one is close. Hopefully we’ll get both of them,” Bruckheimer told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> in December of last year.</p><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=802 data-injectable=false>If the team’s sights are indeed turned towards a younger cast, then Knightley might be right after all, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and Pirates will head in a new direction</a> than the one hinted at in that post-credits scene. Or perhaps she’s giving the press the evasive treatment to keep her return as much of a surprise as possible. Seeing as the sixth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series is still a long way away, there is not much we can do but wait to find out which interpretation is right.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8qeoKuZXaC7qrPHraOesV2WsaW%2BxKyqnqtdlnqxu9KsoJuklWK%2FpsDUq6VmrJ9ivaq%2BwK2crGWfm3q1tMRmmpqqmZevpq3NaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
