A manhunt ensued, but Williams eluded capture for nearly three months.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d2r3ijz46v2k0u.cloudfront.net/d93c3ff3-9a02-4fe9-b427-ab7234175559.jpg><h2 class=split>Inside the ruthless McLelland home invasion</h2><p>In late March 2013, accompanied by his wife Kim Williams, Eric knocked on the McLellands' home door, impersonating a police officer. Once inside, Williams callously unloaded a barrage of bullets, taking the lives of the district attorney and his wife. Kim, acting as a getaway driver, later testified that Williams considered Cynthia "collateral damage" and coldly recounted his deeds, <a href=# rel=noopener>WFAA</a> reports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d2r3ijz46v2k0u.cloudfront.net/0a577c6b-fc6c-447a-86cd-83912e3bce73.jpeg><p>She pleaded guilty and received a 40-year prison sentence for her involvement in the murders. However, Williams, undeterred, now argues that he was denied a fair trial during the initial proceedings. He contends that he was unable to adequately prepare for his case, faced bias from the presiding judge, and dealt with a hostile media atmosphere.</p><p>The former judge's case venue had been moved from Kaufman County to Rockwall County due to intense media scrutiny, but Williams argues that this change was insufficient. Public records indicate that this is not the first attempt by Williams to secure a retrial.</p><h2 class=split>Eric Williams' horrifying parallels to infamous killers</h2><p>In 2018, an appeal to the US Supreme Court was met with strong opposition from prosecutors who emphasized Williams “waged war" on the entire criminal justice system. During the sentencing for the McLelland murders, Judge Mike Snipes likened his ruthlessness to notorious serial killers, expressing concerns that Williams, given the opportunity, would kill again.</p><p>“That puts you right there with Charles Manson, Jeffrey Dahmer and Richard Speck,” Snipes said, as per <a href=# rel=noopener>KERA</a>. Nevertheless, the evidence presented during the trial revealed Williams' extensive collection of at least 30 guns, his desire to harm other justice officials, and threats toward his wife and an ex-girlfriend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb7nEmq6wZpOkunCx0aKaZq%2BZobmqrcysZJ%2BnoqKys3nTnq%2Baq12fwqWzxGaaqKamnrC1scNmpp9lk6S5pXnBpaaonJWZeq7B0Z2cq2Wfm3qlrYyhoKxlp56zpnnAp5tmqKKkwKav1K2mq2WjmrKsv4ynnLBllJqutbSMqZynmZypxm7A0aKYpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
