He recently spoke to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Page Six</a> about&nbsp;a number of topics and when his past relationship with Janet Jackson was mentioned, JD spoke about the tattoo he got down his right side for her.</p><p>Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images</p><p>In case you forgot, Dupri got a giant portrait of Janet Jackson on his side when they were dating. If you ask him about it today though, he'll tell you he doesn't regret a thing about it. "I have a tattoo of her — but I know her," said the producer. "People have tattoos of people that they do not know. So when I got the Janet tattoo people were like, ‘What if y’all break up?’ But this is someone I know. I don’t regret Janet’s tattoo — we have matching ones."</p><p>JD has faced online criticism for failing to recognize major milestones in his ex-girlfriend's life, including her birthdays. He also touched on the backlash he's received by saying that not everything has to be done publicly. If he wants to wish Janet a happy birthday, he can literally pick up the phone and do so.</p><p>Would you/have you ever gotten your&nbsp;partner tattooed on your skin?</p><p>Dave Hogan/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiZ352gJVmoZ6qnZa2r7GMnaypqplitaK%2FjKemZqmllrmuv4yamaitpGK1qr%2BMoKCapqRit6K6xK1ko5mToMCwuoytmK2sn6R6r7HWrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
