Recently, once again, fans started to worry about the state of their relationship. This time, due to an unfortunate comment from Hailey's father, in which he asked for "a little prayer" for the couple. Hailey wasn't happy about the rumors, and took advantage of Justin's 30th birthday to set the record straight. Things are perfectly fine between them.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:06</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/justin-and-hailey-bieber-have-revealed-strange-facts-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Justin And Hailey Bieber Have Revealed Strange Facts About Their Marriage">Justin And Hailey Bieber Have Revealed Strange Facts About Their Marriage</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>What have Justin and Hailey Bieber said about their rather bizarre married life?</p><p>That is not the case for the rest of Hailey's family, however.

The video featured Justin Bieber singing "I Could Sing of Your Love Forever" by Delirious? and Hillsong Worship, and the message below read:</p><p>"<strong>Christians, please when you think of Justin & Hailey, take a moment to offer a little prayer for them to have wisdom, protection and to draw close to the Lord</strong>."</p><h2 id=hailey-bieber-39-s-sister-alaia-baldwin-39-s-arrest-drama>Hailey Bieber's Sister Alaia Baldwin's Arrest Drama</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/alaia-baldwin-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>After the news of Alaia Baldwin's arrest broke, Stephen Baldwin's request took a different meaning</strong>.
