So it would be possible to have not duelling Jokers but someone that [claims] to be the Joker that isn't the Joker," the 66-year-old actor told the outlet.</p><p>"And that kind of opens up the possibility of an interesting story, particularly if you had Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker, and then you had someone who was either imitating or riffing off what he did," he continued.
