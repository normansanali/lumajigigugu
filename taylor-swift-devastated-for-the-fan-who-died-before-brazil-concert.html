The country music star wrote a heartfelt note and posted it on her Instagram story to express her sorrow over the loss of her fan. The note said,</p><p>“I can’t believe I’m writing these words but it is with a shattered heart that I say we lost a fan earlier tonight before my show,” the 12-times Grammy Award winner star wrote in a handwritten note to mourn her fan, “I can’t even tell how devastated I am by this. There’s very little information I have other than the fact she was so incredibly beautiful and far too young.”</p><p>A Brazilian daily newspaper reporter, Folha de S. Paulo, covered the sad news of the tragic death of the fan. According to her report, 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides fainted at the venue of the concert, Estadio Olimpico Nilton Santos. She was revived at the venue and later transferred to the hospital for treatment, where she unfortunately died. The cause of death was determined to be cardiorespiratory arrest. Benevides’s cousin, Estela Benevides, confirmed her death to reporter Folha. It is unclear if the devoted fan saw her favourite star perform when the show began at around 7:30 p.m. Brazil time.</p><p>The heart-wrenching incident happened due to the heat wave hitting Brazil. The temperature was recorded at 140 degrees in Rio de Janeiro, where the concert occurred. According to Folha, Firefighters recorded nearly one thousand people fainting at the show. Some fans revealed on social media that they were not allowed to bring water bottles inside the venue, prompting the singer to pause the show several times to help her fans have access to water, at one point even throwing a water bottle herself into the audience.</p><p>In the wake of a fan’s death, Swift penned down a heartfelt note to express her grief over the loss of a beautiful young woman. Swift also mentioned that she will not be able to speak about the incident at her next show as she feels “overwhelmed by grief” when she attempts to talk about the horrific incident. She said,</p><p>“I want to say now I feel this loss deeply and my broken heart goes out to her family and friends,” she continues, “This is the last thing I ever thought would happen when we decided to bring this tour to Brazil.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7trzTqKqpnZWZt7DB0aeYpaGjonuku8xopZ6vo2TBosXLqKlmq6ees7V5w56tmquklsGmsIyfpqtlpJ2ybrLAp2SwoJ9isaqxw2aZnp6fp7JurtGasaKkXZi8r6%2FEq6to</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
