Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful (via Fightful Select) reports that, as of a few weeks ago, AEW and Warner Bros. Discovery had not reached a deal that would bring the company to Max. The report noted that WWE’s deal that will bring SmackDown back to USA Network could affect AEW."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

NBA has been a key part of TNT for years, and a bid could affect the budget for USA or NBCU getting the rights to RAW or NXT.</p><p>On the other hand, this scenario would likely affect WBD as well. Sapp wrote that AEW and WBD were unable to agree to a new deal that would include AEW’s television rights, pay-per-views, and the company’s library. WBD sources said that they’ve been happy with the AEW partnership, and they’re looking for it to continue. They also stated that Khan has a particular value that he believes the library is worth.</p><p>WrestleZone will provide more information as it becomes available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqb2tpaGK%2FprzOq6tmr5KZeqmtz6mwZq%2BZqbVurcSwZKmZoqm7pr7SoaCpZaeWu7V5yK1kraddmLyvwMinrJ4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
