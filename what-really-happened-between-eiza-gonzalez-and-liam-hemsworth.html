The Aussie actor and <a href=#>his longtime love Miley Cyrus</a> shared the news that they were calling it quits in September 2013, and the following day, Hemsworth was photographed kissing González. Per <a href=#>People</a>, the two actors had met at a boxing match in Las Vegas a few days earlier. But Hemsworth soon headed to Atlanta to film "The Hunger Games," and in February 2014, he was spotted locking lips with "The Vampire Diaries" star Nina Dobrev at a local bar, per <a href=#>Celebuzz</a>. González, meanwhile, went on to date her "From Dusk Till Dawn" co-star D.J. Cotrona, with the couple making their relationship Instagram official in September 2014, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Latin Post</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2017, <a href=#>Latina&nbsp;Magazine</a> asked González about her relationship with Hemsworth, but she refused to talk about it. "I focus on my work, that's what really matters," she stated. The actor further explained her decision, saying, "I don't think that it's necessary. I think that your life as [a] public person is already so exposed."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmxmZ350e9ahmK1lopqurbjYZp%2BaqKCau6awjJucra%2BVmrtuscizmGafn6PHorjEs2SappRiuaqtzGafnqWjrLyzwMdo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
