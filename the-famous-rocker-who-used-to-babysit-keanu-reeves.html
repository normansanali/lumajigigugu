When asked if the experience was scary as Fallon held up an image of the gruesome Cooper on the "Welcome 2 My Nightmare" album from 2011, Reeves responded, "Well, he didn't look like that." The rocker clearly has a <a href=#>different vibe than his on-stage persona</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>How on earth did this babysitter scenario unfold? Sometimes it's as simple as who you know. Reeves' mother, Patricia Taylor, was a costume designer and worked with plenty of rockers, via <a href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a>. The family lived on Hazelton Avenue in Toronto, the same street where Nimbus 9 Records was based. "She was in rock-and-roll, in the business, and they had friends and she had friends, and so Alice Cooper, I'm told, babysat me," Reeves explained. He&nbsp;seems to share the same disbelief as everyone else over the peculiar story. "I mean, I don't know how that could actually possibly happen, but it did supposedly,"&nbsp;he told Fallon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGtlboR5e9OhnGaekaK8tr%2BMq6aco5Wneri0zmasrJ2UYsGwecGambKrmal6rLHAp6xmqpWaw6a%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
