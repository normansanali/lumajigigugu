It was unclear, even right up until the end, what they were going to choose. Would Colby, who initially issued the ultimatum, propose? And would Madelyn even accept, considering his infidelity and the fact that he said he didn't regret it? There was also the close bond Madelyn formed during her three-week trial marriage with Randall to take into consideration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Episode 9 revealed the fates of all the original couples from The Ultimatum. It also featured the weddings of those who decided to become engaged — including Colby and Madelyn!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the "Maybe" poem from 'The Ultimatum'?</h2><p>During Madelyn and Colby's wedding ceremony, the officiant recited a poem titled "Maybe," which highlighted the imperfections and trials that come with love. Although some viewers thought <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Colby may have written the piece</a>, the author of "Maybe" is actually anonymous.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We've transcribed the poem as it was read on the show, although there are several iterations of it floating around online. It goes:</p><p>"Maybe we are supposed to meet the wrong people before we meet the right one so when we finally arrive, we are truly grateful for the gift we have been given.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Maybe it’s true that we don’t know what we’ve lost until we lose it, but it is also true that we don’t know what we’re missing until it arrives.</p><p>"Maybe the happiest of people don’t have the best of everything but they make the best of everything that comes their way.</p><p>"Maybe the art of true love is not about finding the perfect person but about seeing an imperfect person perfectly."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Reactions to the "Maybe" poem were mixed.</h2><p>Although throngs of viewers searched the exact words of the "Maybe" poem on Google after viewing Episode 9, not everyone was a fan. One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> user declared, "I swear if anyone asks me to read the 'Maybe' poem from The Ultimatum at their wedding while I officiate it, I’ll turn that wedding down.
