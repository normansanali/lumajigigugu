Exploring the Career and Impact of a Baseball Great</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-07-28</div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fanarch.com/cdn/shop/articles/FOR_ARTICLES_95.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p data-mce-fragment=1>Freddie Freeman, the star first baseman for the Atlanta Braves, has been a dominant force in Major League Baseball (MLB) for over a decade. His exceptional performance in the 2020 season has ignited discussions about his Hall of Fame credentials. In this article, we will examine Freeman's career, his statistical achievements, and the impact he has had on the game, to determine whether he should be considered for the prestigious honor of being a Hall of Famer.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Freddie Freeman's career has been nothing short of remarkable. Since his debut in 2010, he has consistently showcased his exceptional hitting skills and defensive prowess. With a career Wins Above Replacement (WAR) of 38.5, Freeman currently ranks 50th all-time among first basemen. This alone is a testament to his longevity and consistent performance.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Throughout his career, Freeman has established himself as one of the premier first basemen in the league. His offensive contributions have been outstanding, with impressive batting averages, home run totals, and runs batted in (RBIs) year after year. He has been recognized as one of the top three first basemen in several statistical categories over the last decade. His impact on the game extends beyond his individual statistics, as he has played a vital role in the success of the Atlanta Braves, helping lead them to multiple postseason appearances.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Freeman's peak seasons, or WAR7, currently rank him 43rd among first basemen. However, the shortened 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic affected his chances of moving up in the rankings. Despite this setback, his performance in 2020 was exceptional. He was widely regarded as the best hitter in baseball that year, displaying improved selectivity and contact skills. These improvements bode well for his future performance and further solidify his case for the Hall of Fame.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>JAWS (Jaffe WAR Score system) is a metric used to determine a player's Hall of Fame worthiness. Freeman's JAWS score currently stands at 35.2, which is lower than some of his peers. However, it is important to note that JAWS is not the sole factor in determining a player's Hall of Fame status. Freeman's consistent performance, impact on the game, and his ability to be one of the best hitters at his position should not be overlooked.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>To solidify his Hall of Fame case, Freeman needs to continue playing at a high level and build upon his consistent performance. If he can maintain his strong offensive numbers and contribute to the success of the Braves, his chances of being inducted into the Hall of Fame will undoubtedly increase. As Freeman enters the later stages of his career, it will be crucial for him to maintain his health and sustain his level of play.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Freddie Freeman's career has been characterized by consistency, excellence, and impact. While his JAWS score may not be as high as some of his peers, his overall body of work, including his career WAR, offensive prowess, and contributions to the success of the Atlanta Braves, make a strong case for his Hall of Fame induction. With continued success and a sustained level of performance, Freeman has the potential to solidify his place among baseball's all-time greats in the hallowed halls of Cooperstown.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6sn6itnJl6p77EnZuinV2bv6axzJqlZpqVYq5utMClo2anlmKzornEq2SesKChvLO1zaBkraCVYrCivsSeqWaZnpl6qrnPmpqtZZ%2BbeqJ5wZqqnpqRoblus9GemK0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
