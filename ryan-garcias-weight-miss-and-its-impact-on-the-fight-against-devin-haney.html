Weighing in at 143.2 pounds, Garcia exceeded the limit by more than three pounds, leading to significant financial repercussions and implications for the fight itself<a data-mce-fragment=1 class="inline-flex justify-center items-center w-5 h-5 text-xs rounded-full no-underline transition-colors bg-n-fill-accent hover:bg-n-solid-accent text-n-solid-accent-hover hover:text-n-text-inverse" href=# node="[object Object]" data-mce-href=https://www.si.com/boxing/2024/04/19/ryan-garcia-loses-millions-missing-weight-devin-haney-fight>1</a>.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Financial Fallout</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Garcia's weight miss will cost him millions of dollars, as he has agreed to give up $600,000 of his purse to Haney and pay Haney $500,000 per pound for missing weight, resulting in a total payment of $1.5 million. Furthermore, Garcia is ineligible to win the championship, and if Haney loses, the belt would be vacated<a data-mce-fragment=1 class="inline-flex justify-center items-center w-5 h-5 text-xs rounded-full no-underline transition-colors bg-n-fill-accent hover:bg-n-solid-accent text-n-solid-accent-hover hover:text-n-text-inverse" href=# node="[object Object]" data-mce-href=https://www.si.com/boxing/2024/04/19/ryan-garcia-loses-millions-missing-weight-devin-haney-fight>1</a>.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>This financial fallout must impact <a href=# title="Ryan Garcia Net Worth">Ryan Garcia's Net Worth</a> for sure.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Impact on the Fight</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>The weight miss has raised questions about Garcia's preparation for the fight, especially considering that this was only his second bout since being knocked out by Gervonta Davis in a 136-pound fight last April<a data-mce-fragment=1 class="inline-flex justify-center items-center w-5 h-5 text-xs rounded-full no-underline transition-colors bg-n-fill-accent hover:bg-n-solid-accent text-n-solid-accent-hover hover:text-n-text-inverse" href=# node="[object Object]" data-mce-href=https://www.si.com/boxing/2024/04/19/ryan-garcia-loses-millions-missing-weight-devin-haney-fight>1</a>.
