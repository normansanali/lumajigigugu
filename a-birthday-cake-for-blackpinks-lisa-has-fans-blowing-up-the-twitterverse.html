Although initially proposed with good intentions, several factors have caused fans’ wrath. Apparently, the fanbase wished to make the cake with only a $90 budget, and include details as a nod to all the members. Many have called out the organization for not focusing on Lisa as the birthday girl.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s disgusting how some ‘blinks’ want Lisa’s birthday cake to be a OT4 cake or want 4 cakes for each member meanwhile the other members had cakes like this…</p><p>Lets just hope that lisa gets the birthday cake she deserves.</p><p>BLACKPINK PH SCAMMER <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zI9P2jyM4z</a></p>— ❤︎ 리사³²⁷ (@bonlilisa_) <a href=#>February 27, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>What's wrong with you people?

In addition to the cake design not being focused on Lisa, some fans are also expressing their anger regarding the cost of the cake, since it allegedly will have a much lower budget than initially anticipated. It appears that a fundraiser was made to create a larger budget that would increase the quality of the cake— however, the budget stayed under $90.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Again lying because this was your original design:</p><p>You added the camera to save face you but guess what the last design is still ugly !</p><p>Just let Lisa fanbases handle it, they have the money and do not only spent 90$ like you ! <a href=#>https://t.co/ZA4C7rpMjr</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QrZCj3wZ7L</a></p>— LISA ❤️‍🔥#VMA + #EMA WINNER ❤️‍🔥 (@slays_world) <a href=#>February 28, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>Much like any fanbase, BLACKPINK’s only wish for fair treatment for everyone. A fan has even pointed out the several instances in which Lisa has been left out of collaborations. While this is a normal occurrence in K-Pop, many have clearly noticed a pattern when it comes to the Thai dancer, hopping on to defend her on social media — and understandably so.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Reposting in case other tweets like this gets deleted</p><p>LISA DESERVES BETTER<a href=#>#LISA</a> <a href=#>#LALISA</a> <a href=#>#MONEY</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RRQivj5t25</a></p>— 🌺Lisa Soldier💚 (@LisaSoldier10) <a href=#>February 28, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=false>BLACKPINK PH has since dropped the project, leaving it in the hands of other Filipino fanbases, who are now attempting to make amends regarding the situation.
