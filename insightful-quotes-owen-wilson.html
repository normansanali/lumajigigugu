The 46 year-old Texas native made his acting debut in the 1996 film, Bottle Rocket, in which he also served as an executive producer, and co-writer alongside Wes Anderson. &nbsp;Although the film received mixed reviews, it helped critics and viewers alike see the vast potential that Wilson possessed on many levels. &nbsp;The late Roger Ebert, gave the film only two stars but stated: “Bottle Rocket” is entertaining if you understand exactly what it is: if you see it as a film made by friends out of the materials presented by their lives and with the freedom to not push too hard.” &nbsp;Ebert continued by saying: “I can’t recommend the film – it’s too unwound and indulgent – but I have a certain affection for it, and I’m looking forward to whatever Anderson and the Wilsons do next.” In just a few years after his first on-screen appearance, Owen Wilson had become one of film’s leading humorous&nbsp;actors, and&nbsp;showed the entire world exactly what he planned on doing “next.”</p><p>By 2001, his writing and acting skills had earned him an Academy Award nomination for the film, The Royal Tenenbaums, in which he again teamed up with Wes Anderson and earned credits as a co-writer, actor, and executive producer. &nbsp;Although Wilson has had a very successful career, throughout the years, almost all of Wilson’s accolades have come as a result of him being branded a comedic actor. &nbsp;Wilson has expressed that he would love to get the chance to play serious roles more often, but it just hasn’t seemed to work out that way. &nbsp;However, Wilson has often shown that there is much more to him than just a good time and a few jokes. &nbsp;The actor, whose struggle with depression was made public in 2007, seems to be very self-aware as he struggles to find balance in both his life and his career. &nbsp;Here are five of the most insightful quotes from one of Hollywood’s favorite funny guys, Owen Wilson.</p><p>5. “To me, being cool is just the opposite of living. It’s about not getting too worked up about anything, by being ‘Nyah, nyah, nyah,’ and no big deal. I can’t stand that. It’s such a jaded, clichéd posture to take. I get real enthusiastic about stuff. It’s what I think is life-affirming.”</p><p>Growing up, almost everyone desires to fit in and be cool. &nbsp;Most of the “cool” people depicted in movies and/or films are often calm, laid back, and afraid to let loose. However, eventually most people realize that pretending not to care about things is actually far less cool than it seems.</p><p>4. “I don’t like caring what other people think, but I do. There’s a freedom when you meet someone who doesn’t care, who is just themselves in all situations. I had the way I was with my friends, and then my personality with adults, and that’s continued a little bit. To just be yourself, and not try to sell anything, or make a good impression, that’s something worth striving towards.”</p><p>As a Hollywood star, Owen Wilson is probably bombarded with millions of opinions each day, and admits that ignoring those outside opinions is still something that he struggles with. But even for those of us who with far fewer fans and critics, it can still be difficult to ignore those who insists on making their points of view known. &nbsp;However, Wilson suggests that true happiness lies in not caring what other people have to say about you, and always remaining true to who you really are.</p><p>3. “…You can’t stay at the party forever. At some point, you have to take stock and ask yourself, ‘What am I doing here?'”</p><p>Although Wilson made this statement in reference to marriage, it can be applied to other life situations as well. &nbsp;It can be easy to become complacent or avoid difficult challenges, but sometimes we all have to take a look at ourselves and really be honest about the choices we’ve made.</p><p>2. “I think of myself as a doom person. I’m a worrier. But I like the idea of being an optimist. Maybe I’m the kind of optimist who deep down knows it’s not going to work.”</p><p>Sometimes it can be hard to find a healthy balance between being positive and being realistic. &nbsp;Although we all hope for the best, sometimes the worst is all we can think about, which can sometime lead to a cycle of subconscious negativity.</p><p>1. “I’ve started to notice that, as you get older, mental health is as fragile as physical health. I’ve never had a breakdown, but you can really get sideswiped by stuff like depression.”</p><p>As we age, our bodies and minds do go through various changes. &nbsp;However, for Wilson, the irony in this quote is unbelievable. In August 2007, Owen Wilson was rushed to the hospital after what was believed to be a suicide attempt. &nbsp;Rumors immediately began to circulate regarding what had sparked the incident, and although no reason for his behavior was confirmed, Wilson’s lawyer did share that he was undergoing treatment for depression. During an interview, Wilson’s younger&nbsp;brother, Luke, who found his brother and called 911, opened up about his feelings regarding his brother’s health. &nbsp;Luke Wilson confessed that he wasn’t sure if his brother was going to be okay. &nbsp;However, since the incident Wilson has gone on to star in several successful films, and from the outside at least, seems to be doing much better.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGigp6uZnLW1stSlZKqtn6mytHnOsJynZaeeubS7zWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
