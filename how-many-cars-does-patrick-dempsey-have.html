It only makes sense for him to own lots of cars, doesn’t it?&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a list of the cars Dempsey has:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Panoz Esperante GT</li><li>Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Gullwing</li><li>Jaguar XK120</li><li>1963 Porsche 356</li><li>Lotus Exige S</li><li>Jaguar E-Type Coupe</li><li>Mercedes SL Roadster</li><li>Ferrari Daytona</li><li>1982 Porsche 911 SC</li><li>Porsche 911 GT3 RS</li><li>Porsche 911 Targa</li><li>Mazda RX-8 GT</li><li>Porsche 911 RSR</li><li>Lola B12/87 Le Mans Prototype</li><li>Ferrari F430 GT2</li></ul><p>Let’s take a look at some of them.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Panoz Esperante GT</h3><p>Perhaps one of the rarest cars in Dempsey’s collection, the Panoz Esperante GT, is hand-built in the US featuring a large yet mighty V8 engine derived from the Corvette.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Panoz</a>, the car provides a “truly captivating driving experience that delivers unrivaled levels of endurance and high-intensity performance.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Gullwing</h3><p><a href=# rel=noopener>According to Hot Cars</a>, the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Gullwing is the car you’ll catch Dempsey driving a lot, as it’s his daily driver. Dempsey revealed why he uses this car so much, <a href=# rel=noopener>saying</a>, “It doesn’t alienate people; it brings people to have a great appreciation, no matter if it’s a little kid or an older woman or a guy, it doesn’t matter. People are drawn to the car and have a great appreciation for it.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Lotus Exige S</h3><p>The Lotus Exige S was another of Dempsey’s daily drivers. It’s a British two-door, two-seat sports car that can travel at speeds of up to 273 km/h.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Porsche 911 GT3 RS</h3><p>So by now, you’ve probably realized that Dempsey likes his sports cars. And now we’ve got another one.&nbsp;</p><p>The Porsche 911 GT3 RS is amongst another of Dempsey’s daily drivers. <a href=# rel=noopener>According to Porsche</a>, it’s a car boasting 4.0-liter engine packing 383 kW (520 hp).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Porsche 911 Targa</h3><p>Depending on the model, a Porsche 911 Targa will cost a pretty penny, with <a href=# rel=noopener>prices</a> ranging between $119,000 and $180,000. <a href=# rel=noopener>Dempsey likes this car because</a> “it is instantly recognizable by its aluminum roll hoop and its incredibly complex folding-roof mechanism. It’s designed to offer open-top thrills without sacrificing interior space.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ferrari F430 GT2</h3><p>Dempsey’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Ferrari F430 GT2</a> was completed and delivered to him in 2006. The car raced at one event – the International GT in Barcelona, where it came 17th overall. Even though it’s evident that the actor likes his Porsches, <a href=# rel=noopener>the Ferrari was the car that started his passion for racing</a>.</p><p>The Ferrari F430 is a successor to the Ferrari 360, and <a href=# class=rank-math-link rel=noopener>on this website</a>, the 2006 model sells for around $90,000. <a href=# class=rank-math-link rel=noopener>Ferrari recalled about 2,000</a> (2005–2007) F430 Spiders in the US back in 2009, due to the risk that heat from the engine could cause the convertible top’s hydraulic hoses to fracture and leak flammable fluid onto the engine, resulting in a fire.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mazda RX-8 GT</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The Mazda RX-8 GT is another car that Dempsey has driven on the race tracks, and he loves the car because it is fun to drive, and the car has a great history. It is powered by a rotary Wankel engine and was available for sale in America back in 2003.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqGmsGWdlru6ecKaqaxllKSytHnPmquroZOgeqWxzKmqnrFdna63sY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
