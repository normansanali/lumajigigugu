Clark is 35 and from Washington State. She’s been in Nashville for several years and, recently, has begun to make a name for herself on Music Row."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She’s been in Nashville for several years and, recently, has begun to make a name for herself on Music Row. Her songs have appeared on albums by&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=Hyperlink__Char>Reba McEntire</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=Hyperlink__Char>Darius Rucker</span></a>; she co-wrote two No. 1 country hits, the Band Perry’s zippy new-fangled death ballad “<a href=#><span class=Hyperlink__Char>Better Dig Two</span></a>” and Miranda Lambert’s thumping “<a href=#><span class=Hyperlink__Char>Mama’s Broken Heart</span></a>.” Clark also has writing credits on three of the songs on&nbsp;<span class=Normal__Char>Same Trailer, Different Park</span>, the hit debut by Kacey Musgraves, including “<a href=#><span class=Hyperlink__Char>Follow Your Arrow</span></a>,” the closest thing country has to a left-leaning anthem in 2013. “Follow Your Arrow,” like “Mama’s Broken Heart,” was written by Clark, Musgraves, and the prolific hit-maker&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=Hyperlink__Char>Shane McAnally</span></a>; that trio is part of a loose confederation of musicians who are giving commercial country a jolt, bringing a new kind of emotional realism, a younger perspective, and an injection of progressive politics to pop’s most hidebound genre. (Both Clark and McAnally are gay and uncloseted, a rarity in Nashville.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-39079d978a08b72d590f1ab33eb2d088-4-0-0@published data-word-count=140>In December 2012, Clark released three of the tracks on&nbsp;<span class=Normal__Char>12 Stories</span>. That EP,&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=Hyperlink__Char>available on iTunes</span></a>, is a good appetite-whetter for the album proper. Musically speaking, Clark is a classicist: Her songs are models of fine Music Row handicraft, built from time-tested materials. She’s a brisk, vivid, witty storyteller; her tunes unfold in old-fashioned weepers and chugging honkytonk, with fiddles, pedal steel, and vocal harmonies driving home the punch lines and pathos. Clark is an excellent singer, with a voice that slides easily between songbird prettinesss and hard-drawlin’ twang. You can hear her mastery of songform on “<a href=#><span class=Hyperlink__Char>Stripes</span></a>,” her first single, which plays like a send-up of&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=Hyperlink__Char>Lambert’s gun-slinging revenge anthems</span></a>. Clark catches her lover&nbsp;<span class=Normal__Char>in flangrante</span>, but stops herself from pulling the trigger because she doesn’t look good in prison garb. “There’s no crime of passion/Worth a crime of fashion,” she sings.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-39079d978a08b72d590f1ab33eb2d088-5-0-0@published data-word-count=184>“Stripes” is a hoot, but it’s in the ballads that Clark especially shines. You won’t find “Follow Your Arrow”–style sloganeering in Clark’s music, but there’s no mistaking the realism, or the politics. She sings Great Recession songs — stories of lost souls in lean times. <a href=#>“<span class=Hyperlink__Char>Take a Little Pill</span>”</a> is a song about addiction set against a ravaged rural backdrop. (Clark’s small towns look a lot more like the&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=Hyperlink__Char>meth-plagued American heartland</span></a>&nbsp;than the&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=Hyperlink__Char>county-fair-and-cane-pole-fishin’ idylls</span></a>&nbsp;that are all over country radio.) Even better is “<a href=#><span class=Hyperlink__Char>Pray to Jesus</span></a>,” about the faint hopes of regular Joes and Josephines who “don’t want to be buried in debt or in sin.” Clark sings: “We pray to Jesus and we play the lotto/’Cause there ain’t but two ways we can change tomorrow.” “Pray to Jesus” is a kind of companion piece to Musgraves’s “<a href=#><span class=Hyperlink__Char>Merry Go Round</span></a>,” a deceptively gentle ballad that comes in shuffling and swaying — before clobbering you with the force of a two-ton truck. It’s a magnificent song: sturdy enough to keep you going for the next few months, until you can dig into nine more Brandy Clark stories.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Rosen on Brandy Clark’s 12 Stories</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobGdgbHyzu9KepWannmKvs63NnbBmm5yWv6y%2FjGppZqufo7S0esetpKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
