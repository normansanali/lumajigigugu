Vinny confirmed in a January 2023 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, after filming for the current Jersey Shore: Family Vacation season wrapped, that “there’s no romantic connection” with Angelina.</p><p>In an interview with ET, Vinny revealed:</p><p>Everybody wants that… Absolutely no. I mean, she’s cool, but nah. There’s no romantic connection there.</p><p>He’s gone on the record to say <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he’d “rather jump off” an 18-floor hotel balcony</a> than revisit a romance with her like they once did in season 2 of the OG MTV show. She’s expressed the same, but fans always have hope.</p><p>“I try every day [to set the record straight]. I scream it from the rooftops and no one gets it,” Vinny claims. He also hints that they may have hooked up during Jersey Shore: Family Vacation season 6.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-angelina-admits-she-likes-vinny>Angelina admits she likes Vinny</h2><p><a href=#>Angelina</a> has revealed she has feelings for Vinny to co-star Jenni and has asked for advice on how to get him to take her seriously. During Family Vacation season 6, Vinny did mention the possibility of a romance.</p><p><a href=#>Mike Sorrentino</a> told Vinny that he reckons Angelina is “falling” for his friend and questioned: “So you’re saying there’s a chance?” Vinny, who has always said there’s nothing romantic with her, didn’t deny the curiosity.</p><p>During the season, Angelina has given him a lap dance and admitted her feelings, but then introduced a different Vinny, called Vinny Tortorella, who appears to get down on one knee for her in the trailer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/02/GettyImages-1463997011.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-their-jersey-shore-timeline>Their Jersey Shore timeline</h2><p>Angelina and Vinny hooked up in 2010, during season 2 of Jersey Shore. Then in 2019, she got married to <a href=#>Chris Larangeira</a> as seen on the show. They have since split and gotten divorced as of 2022.</p><p>Overall, they’ve never actually dated properly. Also, the phrase “obsessed with me” is heavily used when referring to the other. Before Angelina was married, it was a long-standing joke about the two potentially ending up together.</p><p>Vinny has tried to find a girlfriend and has done his fair share of dating on Double Shot at Love, but continues to be single following several seasons of the series. His friend Pauly D is still with Nikki Hall from the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/02/GettyImages-1318552154-1024x657.jpg><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH JERSEY SHORE: FAMILY VACATION ON MTV THURSDAYS AT 8/7C</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>INSTAGRAM</a><strong>, </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>FACEBOOK</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>TWITTER</a> AND <a href=# rel=nofollow>TIKTOK</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfosG3e8Cnnp6kmaOubq3NnWSvoZ6jxm6t0Z6lrWWUlsGqusZmm56roJ7BpnnToZitZaOpsqK52GahnqqjmsZuv8eoqZ5lo5iyr7E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
