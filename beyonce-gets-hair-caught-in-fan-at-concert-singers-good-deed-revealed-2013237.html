It was things like ‘graduate from college’ and all the boxes were checked except the last one, which was ‘Sing With Beyonce!'” the source tells <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>“Beyonce was so moved she went down into the pit to sing ‘Halo’ with the girl to give her her final wish,” says the insider. “She wasn’t even thinking of the fan — she was focused on the girl she was trying to do something nice for and it was unprompted. It really came from a good place.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Not that Beyonce, touring the planet for her Mrs. Carter World Tour, doesn’t have a great sense of humor about the whole thing. On her instagram, she shared a video of the snafu and a handwritten <a href=#>Instagram</a> note in which she rewrote the lyrics to “Halo” to address the fan-demonium.</p><p>“Gravity can’t begiiiin/to pull me out of the fan again./I felt my hair was yankiiin/From the fan that’s always hatiiiin,” the memo read. “I got snatched!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmesZ%2BjsKZ5xp6rrGWYlrazecKarKCgpGK2r3nFmqVmmaRisLC6wp6prWWjnruosdGsZKCnn5l6pbHEnWSrnaaarq2xw2ZpaWljZ4B4ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
