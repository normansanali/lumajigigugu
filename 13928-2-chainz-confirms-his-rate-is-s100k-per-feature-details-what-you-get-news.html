Don't even worry about it."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">2 Chainz continued to explain the perks of paying $100k. "The thing is, when it comes to your video, I'm gonna change clothes twice. They're never gonna see that outfit again," he said, before mentioning Givenchy and Alexander McQueen as potential clothing items. "I'm gonna give you bars. I'm gonna wear fancy glasses and a bunch of chains you've never seen. I mean, I can&nbsp;help&nbsp;you."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The rapper continued, "You get me. You get charisma.
