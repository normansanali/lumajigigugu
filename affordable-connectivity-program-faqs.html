Optimum is proudly participating in the Federal Government’s Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), a longer-term $14 billion program that replaced the Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) Program. This program helps eligible low-income households that qualify based on Federal Government rules pay for Internet or Mobile service. It'll help ensure Americans can afford the connections they need for work, school, health care and more.
NOTE: The Affordable Connectivity Program no longer accepts new applications and enrollments as of February 7, 2024."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This program helps eligible low-income households that qualify based on Federal Government rules pay for Internet or Mobile service. It'll help ensure Americans can afford the connections they need for work, school, health care and more.</p><p>NOTE: The Affordable Connectivity Program no longer accepts new applications and enrollments as of February 7, 2024. Congress didn’t approve additional funding to keep the ACP running. As a result, the ACP may end in the coming months – as early as April 2024. Although the Federal Government no longer accepts new ACP enrollments, you can easily transfer an existing benefit from another provider to Optimum while the ACP has funding.</p><p><strong><u>How do I transfer my Affordable Connectivity benefit from another service provider to Optimum Internet or Optimum Mobile?</u></strong>&nbsp;<br>If you're receiving an Affordable Connectivity Program credit with another service provider, you may ask us to transfer your benefit to Optimum Internet or Mobile, which means you'll lose the benefit with your current provider once you're enrolled with Optimum. A household can only receive one Affordable Connectivity Program credit at a time. When you fill out your enrollment application with us, please be sure you answer “Yes” when you are asked “Are you currently receiving an Affordable Connectivity Program credit from another service provider for this address?”</p><p><strong><u>How do I transfer my Affordable Connectivity Program benefit from my Optimum Mobile service to my Optimum Internet service?</u></strong>&nbsp;<br>If you’re currently receiving an Affordable Connectivity Program benefit on your Optimum Mobile service and would like to transfer it to your Optimum Internet service, you may ask us to transfer your benefit.

We’ll notify you of our decision at the email address you provided within 5 business days.</p><p><strong><u>What should I do if I haven’t received an email from Optimum about my transfer eligibility?</u></strong>&nbsp;<br>It may take us up to 5 business days after we receive your transfer application to process it and notify you. If it has been more than 6 business days since you applied, but you haven't received an enrollment status email, please check your junk or spam folders for our message. If you haven't received an eligibility email, call us at <a href=#>866.670.0855</a>.</p><p><strong><u>Can I re-apply for the Affordable Connectivity Program with Optimum if my transfer application was not approved?</u></strong>&nbsp;<br>Yes, if you believe you're eligible to transfer your affordable connectivity benefit to Optimum, please re-apply.</p><p><strong><u>I received an email saying my household information is already tied to another participant in the program. What do I do?</u></strong>&nbsp;<br>If you or someone in your household are receiving an Affordable Connectivity Program credit with another service provider, you may ask us to transfer your benefit to Optimum, which means you'll lose the benefit with your current provider once you are enrolled with Optimum. A household can only receive one Affordable Connectivity Program credit at a time.</p><p>To transfer your benefit to us, please re-apply at Optimum.com/ACPapp. When you fill out your enrollment form with us, please be sure you answer “Yes” when you are asked “Are you currently receiving an Affordable Connectivity Program credit from another service provider for this address?”</p><p><strong><u>I want to change my Internet service tier. Will I still get the Affordable Connectivity Program credit?&nbsp;</u></strong>&nbsp;<br>You can change your Internet service to any tier and retain the credit up to $30/month (up to $75/month for households on Tribal Lands).</p><p><strong><u>I received a message stating my account number is incorrect. What should I do?</u></strong>&nbsp;<br>When entering your account number on your Optimum form, you’ll need to type the first 13 digits (without dashes) that appear on your bill or order confirmation email.</p><p>NOTE: Be sure to enter ONLY the first 13 digits without dashes and ignore any extra digits.</p><p><strong><u>Who developed the eligibility criteria for the Affordable Connectivity Program?</u></strong>&nbsp;<br>Congress created the Affordable Connectivity Program, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted the rules and polices governing how the program operates. The Commission’s Wireline Competition Bureau, other Commission staff, and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) oversee and administer the Affordable Connectivity Program.</p><p><strong><u>Can I choose to no longer receive the Affordable Connectivity Program credit?:</u></strong><br>We’ll be sorry to hear it, but if you no longer want to participate in the Affordable Connectivity Program with Optimum, or if you need to tell us that you no longer qualify, we’ll make it easy. Just send an email to <a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=e4b7b7abb4b7a4a588908d8781b1b7a5ca878b89>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> letting us know why you are leaving the program and include the following information as it appears on your bill:</p><li>Account Number</li><li>First and Last Name</li><li>Service Address</li><p><strong><u>Once I'm enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program with Optimum Internet or Mobile do I have to do anything to keep my credit?</u></strong>&nbsp;<br>Yes, Federal Government rules require you to remain eligible to receive the affordable connectivity benefit. If you no longer qualify, you will be de-enrolled. Additionally, subscribers that receive their service for free after the Affordable Connectivity Program benefit is applied must use their service at least once every 30 days to maintain their benefit. Subscribers who do not use their service at least once in any 30-day period risk being de-enrolled from the Affordable Connectivity Program.</p><p><strong><u>Can I transfer my Affordable Connectivity Program benefit to another person or household?</u></strong>&nbsp;<br>The Affordable Connectivity Program is limited to one per household and isn't transferable to another household or another individual even if they may qualify.</p><p><strong><u>What happens after the Affordable Connectivity Program ends?</u></strong>&nbsp;<br>Based on Federal Government rules, the monthly credit will continue for qualified households until the federal funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program is depleted. When the Affordable Connectivity Program ends, your bill will continue to reflect the services and pricing as of that date without the Affordable Connectivity Program credit. This means that you'll be charged the regular, undiscounted, rate for the services you selected until cancelled, and you'll be subject to our regular terms and conditions. If you're having trouble paying your bill, please call us at any time to review available options to lower your bill.</p><p><strong><u>What if I'm having problems getting my affordable connectivity benefit?</u></strong><br>If you have any questions or concerns about your affordable connectivity benefit, please call us immediately so that we can resolve your concern.</p><ul><li>Customers in NY, NJ, CT, PA, Hendersonville, NC, and West Jefferson, NC, please call <a href=#>866.347.4216</a></li><li>Customers in all other areas, please call <a href=#>877.838.2403</a></li></ul><p>If you have any questions or concerns about your affordable connectivity benefit, please call us immediately at <a href=#>866.347.4216</a> so we can resolve your concern.
