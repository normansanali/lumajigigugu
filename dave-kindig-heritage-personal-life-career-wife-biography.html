passion for Hot Wheels, drawing and Legos and it’s no wonder he’s now made a career out of it.&nbsp;He is very successful as the owner and chief designer of the custom car shop ‘Kindig-It’.&nbsp;The store is located in Salt Lake, Utah and has 27,000 square feet of work space.</span></p><p><span>He with his entire team of skilled mechanics and designers redesigned several cars.&nbsp;They start by sketching out his ideas, then they carve out the model on paper, and finally they put his idea into practice.&nbsp;His service is expensive and Dave realizes it’s not affordable for everyone.&nbsp;But still, due to his popularity status, he has clients lining up to receive his opinion.&nbsp;Now let’s learn more about Dave.</span></p><h2><span>Dave Kindig: early life and education</span></h2><p><span>Dave Rick Kindig was born on February 6, 1991 in Salt Lake, Utah.&nbsp;As it happens with people with normal people before they find fame, not much is known about his early life.&nbsp;Although Dave, in his teens, has a deep passion for cars and creativity.</span></p><p><span>At age 17, Dave fell in love with classic Volkswagen Beetles.&nbsp;This creative individual then started working as a graphic and customization designer.&nbsp;There have also been reports of him working for 8 long years in the field of high performance coatings company.&nbsp;Those companies worked with ceramic coating on the exhaust system to display the cars at car shows.</span></p><h2><span>Dave Kindig: Career</span></h2><p><span>Dave likes to constantly joke that he has an engineering degree in Hot Wheels and Legos.&nbsp;He, however, is a self-made designer who never went to art school.&nbsp;He hasn’t even attended college, but got into this field because of his love of cars.&nbsp;Dave was passionate about drawing and designing model cars, so he put together lego pieces to design cars.</span></p><p><span>Most recently, Dave has his own television show, ‘Bitching Rides’, and is among the most watched shows on the Velocity network.&nbsp;The show premiered in 2014, but long before that, it was a prominent name in the design industry.&nbsp;This program just added shine to his work and gave him the marketing power, and now the business is booming.</span></p><p><span>Kindig offers a unique service and is equally expensive.&nbsp;He, on average, earns a six figure sum to redesign a car and that is not something that many can afford.&nbsp;He entered this field at the age of 29, hoping to showcase his creative talents and it is exactly what he has been able to do today.&nbsp;Interestingly, he never uses computers to create designs, instead he draws them in about 2 minutes.&nbsp;Today Dave has been able to extend his service to big names in the industry including Lotus, Lamborghini, Dodge and Harley Davidson.</span></p><h2><span>Dave Kindig: Personal Life</span></h2><p><span>Dave is married to his beloved Charity Kindig.&nbsp;The two have been together since 1992 and his wife is the co-founder of Kindig-it Design.&nbsp;They have embarked on a car restoration service journey in their manufacturing workshop.</span></p><p><span>The family grew in size when Charity gave birth to her first child Baylee and later a son Drew.&nbsp;In 2016, Dave’s daughter Baylee got engaged and Dave announced the news on Twitter.</span></p><p><span>Dave constantly mentions his wife as the best thing that ever happened to him.&nbsp;He was inspired by Charity to follow her dreams of owning a custom car shop.&nbsp;The duo have now celebrated 26 years of being together.&nbsp;They seem happy and perfect for each other and we wish them all the luck in the future.</span></p><h2><span>Dave Kindig: History</span></h2><p><span>Kindig is the owner of ‘Kindig-It Design’ and has been with the company for decades.&nbsp;His factory covers an area of ​​27,00 square feet and has personal, commercial and design buildings.&nbsp;He earns most of his money from modifying cars and bicycles, and his participation in the TV show also has advantages for him.&nbsp;The Bitchin’ Rides program has been a huge success over the years and continues to make money from merchandise sales.</span></p><p><span>As of 2018, his net worth is in the range of $3 million.&nbsp;She has been a hugely successful name in the industry, but remains the same humble and loving person.&nbsp;Kindig is also active on social media and has over 208,000 followers on&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow
