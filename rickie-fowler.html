He was too preoccupied with his goal of shooting the lowest round in the U.S. Open’s 123-year history to worry about her.</p><p>However, the Jupiter homeowner talked to The Palm Beach Post on Wednesday (14 June) before he practiced his short game. Fowler, who was hitting balls with Justin Thomas at Michael Jordan’s Grove XXIII in Hobe Sound when he learned about the transaction last week, expressed shock and disbelief like the rest of us.</p><p>Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan met with Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, in private for seven weeks before announcing the record-breaking deal, but unlike Jon Rahm, he does not feel deceived by this.</p><p>Fowler shot an 8-under 62, which was matched by Xander Schauffele. It’s hard to say betrayed because we don’t know the ins and outs of everything, Fowler said.</p><p><strong>Take a look at the below tweet about the match:</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Do this again tomorrow <a href=# rel=noopener>@RickieFowler</a> ? <a href=#>https://t.co/7eY2SFH91u</a></p><p>— Xander Schauffele (@XSchauffele) <a href=# rel=noopener>June 15, 2023</a></p><p>Jay, in my opinion, has done a wonderful job. Perhaps it could have been improved. Probably. But things have been going swimmingly on this tour. So, have some faith till we find out more about the situation. They see this as their best opportunity in the long run. But at this time we have no idea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Rickie-Fowler-Thursday-Match.webp><p>Just as he did when LIV approached him about quitting the PGA Tour for them last year, Fowler wants the Tour to do their study before making any judgments. At the conclusion of his experience, Fowler was even more certain that the PGA Tour is the greatest place to be.</p><p>The motivation for Fowler’s research was simple:</p><p>“I wanted to learn about it and at least do my due diligence,” he explained.</p><p>And that was, I would say, one area where a lot of us were dissatisfied with the tour was not meeting with the guys at LIV, whether it was Yasir and all the other folks that were involved, just to learn about it. If you think it’s a horrible idea, do it anyhow.</p><p>Even if you think what’s happening today is a horrible idea, you should still find out all the facts so you can form your own opinion.</p><p><strong>You can also take a look at other posts we have covered about MLS 2023 and Elly De La Cruz’s debut at Reds:</strong></p><p>When asked if he considered signing with LIV, <strong>Fowler replied-</strong></p><p>“No, no, no. Simply looking at it, I was motivated to absorb as much information as possible.”</p><p>According to Fowler, the PGA Tour is unrivaled. He maintains this view despite the fact that he said last week set everything back to “square one.”</p><p><strong>He said:</strong></p><p>“I think the tour has done a lot of great things in the last couple of years with players getting together to work on some stuff, how to improve, how to evolve.”</p><p>But you must develop and shift and adapt constantly. I think a lot of progress was made in that area. Everything seems to be going back to the beginning now.</p><p>If you want to check out more latest sports news articles then you can join us on our <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter account</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdga3xyg46roJyjmZp6p7vWpZyrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
