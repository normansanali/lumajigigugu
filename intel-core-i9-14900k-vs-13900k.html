The Core i9-14900K fixes some of the weaker areas of the Core i9-13900K. However, as you can read in our Intel Core i9-14900K review, the new processor does very little to justify spending a higher price for largely the same performance."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It brings the same number of cores and the same architecture as <a href=#>last-gen’s Core i9-13900K</a>, but Intel asserts that the new chip delivers some performance improvements. Is that true, and is it worth ditching last-gen’s flagship for what Intel claims is its <a href=#>best processor</a>?</p><p>The Core i9-14900K fixes some of the weaker areas of the Core i9-13900K. However, as you can read in our <a href=#>Intel Core i9-14900K review</a>, the new processor does very little to justify spending a higher price for largely the same performance.</p><h2>Pricing and availability</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><p>Both the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-14900K come with the same recommended price from Intel: $590. These are flagship chips, and you should expect to spend close to $600 for either processor. The Core i9-13900K has the benefit of being older, though.</p><p>You can commonly find it for around $560, with it sometimes dropping down to $540 when on sale. There’s a good chance the price will drop further in the weeks following the release of the Core i9-14900K. We see that with last-gen parts all the time. Intel’s Core i9-12900K, for example, is now readily available for $375 despite being a $550 processor just a year ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The Core i9-14900K is listed at $590, but it’s already selling for more. As we’ve seen with Intel’s last two flagships, the Core i9-14900K will likely sell between $620 and $640 for at least a few months. Currently, the processor is selling for $630.</p><p>As is usually the case with comparing two processors, you’ll have to weigh the performance against the price you find each chip at. Between the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-14900K, there’s anywhere from a $10 to $100 difference depending on what happens after the launch dust has settled. If only $10 or $20 separates the chips, it’s worth getting the new processor. However, in the likely case there’s a gap of $70 or more, you’re already getting most of the performance with the less expensive Core i9-13900K.</p><h2>Specs</h2><p>There’s not much to talk about in terms of specs with the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-14900K because, on paper, they look almost identical. Both processors use the Intel 7 node, and they come with 24 cores split across eight performance cores and 16 efficiency cores, totaling 32 threads.</p><p>The only difference is clock speed. The Core i9-14900K can boost to 6GHz out of the box, while the Core i9-13900K tops out at 5.8GHz. In addition, the Core i9-14900K comes with a 200MHz boost to both the base and boost clock speeds of the performance cores and efficiency cores.</p><table class=styled border=0 align=center><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Core i9-14900K</strong></td><td><strong>Core i9-13900K</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cores/Threads</strong></td><td>24 (8+16) / 32</td><td>24 (8+16) / 32</td></tr><tr><td><strong>L3/L2 Cache</strong></td><td>36MB / 32MB</td><td>36MB / 32MB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Max turbo frequency</strong></td><td>6GHz</td><td>5.6GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Base/Turbo power</strong></td><td>125W / 253W</td><td>125W / 253W</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Current price</strong></td><td><span data-cloudcity=1 data-pid=b9CMPyNOz3 data-type=textlink id=dtcc-b9CMPyNOz3 class=dtcc-affiliate--textlink>$630</span></td><td><span data-cloudcity=1 data-pid=pXopmDgaqN data-type=textlink id=dtcc-pXopmDgaqN class=dtcc-affiliate--textlink>$570</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Everything else is identical, including the 36MB of L3 cache, 32MB of L2 cache, and 253 watts of maximum turbo power. It’s a shame there wasn’t at least a bump to cache, especially with <a href=#>AMD’s 3D V-Cache</a> processors still dominating gaming charts. There would likely be a better incentive to spend up for the Core i9-14900K in that case.</p><h2>Productivity performance</h2><p>For raw CPU power, the Core i9-14900K doesn’t improve much on the Core i9-13900K. In our tests, there were some cases where it was slightly worse. In Cinebench R23’s multi-core test, the Core i9-14900K was about 3% slower than the Core i9-13900K. Not a good start.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>To be clear, this is probably due to a difference in silicon — based on other tests, it appears we have a particularly speedy Core i9-13900K. But even that explanation only brings the Core i9-14900K up to par. It’s hard to justify spending more for identical performance, much less a regression in performance. There wasn’t a regression in single-core performance, but both processors put up basically the same result.</p><p>That’s not the only test where we saw largely identical performance. In Blender 3.4, there are only marginal differences between the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-14900K. You could swap the names on this chart and there would be no difference in the conclusion. That’s also not good for the Core i9-14900K.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Those are the weakest tests for the Core i9-14900K, however. In a transcoding test like Handbrake, the Core i9-14900K managed to finish the task 8% faster than the Core i9-13900K. That’s likely the higher boost clock speed at work. It’s not a massive improvement, but the extra boost might be worth it if you do a lot of video editing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In 7-Zip, the Core i9-14900K shows the clearest improvement. On the back of better compression performance, it ended up 15% faster than the Core i9-13900K. Decompression is usually more important, especially in tasks like gaming, but it’s good to see Intel make some improvements in this benchmarks that’s normally dominated by AMD processors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Another area where the Core i9-14900K shows a lead is Y-Cruncher, though it’s not as stark as in 7-Zip. In calculating 500 million digits of Pi, the Core i9-14900K was able to complete the task 9% faster when using a single core, and 14% faster when using every core.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The largest performance jump came in Jetstream 2. This web-based benchmark showed the Core i9-14900K around 16% ahead of the Core i9-13900K. That’s a massive jump for web-based applications, but you don’t usually buy a flagship CPU for web apps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That’s the biggest problem for the Core i9-14900K. It shows some improvements, but not in the areas where it matters most. For instance, in PugetBench for Photoshop, the Core i9-14900K posted almost identical numbers to the Core i9-13900K.</p><h2>Gaming performance</h2><p>Intel has highlighted the gaming improvements of the Core i9-14900K over the previous generation, likely to close the gap with chips like the <a href=#>Ryzen 7 7800X3D</a>. And there are some clear improvements here, even if they aren’t big enough to justify a new flagship CPU.</p><p>At a high level, the Core i9-14900K was 20% faster than the Core i9-13900K in 3DMark Time Spy. We’re looking specifically at the CPU score of this test as well. That’s a huge jump, but unfortunately, it only applies to this synthetic test.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If we look at&nbsp;Hitman 3,&nbsp;that lead shrinks to about 10%. That’s still a respectable jump in gaming performance, but it’s a far cry from what we saw in 3DMark. Similarly, in F1 2022,&nbsp;the Core i9-14900K showed an improvement of about 9%.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The largest boost comes in&nbsp;Far Cry 6,&nbsp;where we saw the Core i9-14900K outpace the Core i9-13900K by close to 33%. It’s worth pointing out where that the Core i5-13600K even showed a higher score than the flagship, so there could be shenanigans with how tasks were scheduled across the performance and efficiency cores. We’ve seen that previously with Intel’s hybrid architecture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Although the Core i9-14900K shows performance improvements at 1080p with High graphics settings, you likely won’t be using this processor for 1080p gaming with lowered settings. If we look at&nbsp;Red Dead Redemption 2&nbsp;with its Ultra preset, you can see the Core i9-14900K actually ended up a few frames slower than the Core i9-13900K. This graphically demanding game is a good reminder that <a href=#>your graphics card</a> will play a more significant role in overall gaming performance as you increase your resolution and graphics settings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2>Which is best?</h2><span data-cloudcity=1 data-pid=pXopmDgaqN data-type=widget data-limit=2 id=dtcc-pXopmDgaqN class=dtcc-affiliate--widget></span><p>Currently, those upgrading from a 12th-gen or older CPU should go with the Core i9-14900K. It’s about $50 more expensive than the Core i9-13900K, and it brings some solid performance improvements. This is the limit for the Core i9-14900K, though.</p><p>When the Core i9-13900K inevitably slips in price further, it’s the better option. It offers most of the performance of its 14th-gen counterpart for a lower price. In addition, those already using a Core i9-13900K have very little reason to upgrade. The Core i9-14900K is faster, but not by enough to justify spending more than $600 on a new CPU.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfmLyuvNStoKefX567tbHLZpqoqpVitnp5kG1waWibYsO0eZBscGlom2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
