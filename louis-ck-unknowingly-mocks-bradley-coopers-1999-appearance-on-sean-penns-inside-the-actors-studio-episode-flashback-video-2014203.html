Unknowingly Mocks Bradley Cooper's 1999 Flashback Video</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-20</div><p>Not quite! <strong>Louis C.K.</strong> is famous for his humor and wit, but this time the joke is on him. A hilarious mash-up video of the comedian surfaced <a href=#>via Reddit</a> on Wednesday, March 19, from his 2008 interview on <strong>Stephen Merchant</strong>‘s radio show “The Steve Show.” During the chat, he joked that inspiring actors who ask questions to stars like “<a href=#><strong>Sean Penn</strong></a>” on Inside the Actors Studio never get famous. The problem with that logic? His then-unknown American Hustle costar<strong> <a href=#>Bradley Cooper</a> </strong>did just that back in 1999.&nbsp;</p><p>“It always occurs to me, you know when an actor stands up in the audience and says, ‘I’m an actor, what can I do?’ and asks Sean Penn or whoever. ‘What can I do to reach your level, or whatever,'” the 46-year-old scoffed to Merchant at the time. “And you just want to say, ‘That’s it.

My question is regarding Hurlyburly. What was it like to revisit a character Eddie after a 10-year hiatus? Did you have new discoveries, did you find that it was a different approach because you had already done this character before?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And it wasn’t Cooper’s only time in the Q&A spotlight. That same year, the aspiring star similarly asked <strong>Robert De Niro</strong> a question from the audience. (The actors later starred together in 2011’s Limitless and played father and son in 2012’s Oscar-winning film Silver Linings Playbook.) In 2011, the multiple Oscar nominee officially proved Louis C.K. wrong when he switched roles and joined host <strong>James Lipton</strong> on stage as his guest.</p><p>Watch the hilarious mash-up video now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalp6WewG6vymasp6OepMSqusalsGaln5i4tHnBq5idpJWueqS7zqmcq6tdZoZ6hYyap6mdkaeur6%2FEZqanZaOarq95z56lp6tdnru0tcOeZK2glWKupMDOq6pmq6Sqsaq7jJ6noqufmbJussuaqqGakZi4bsLInZyoZWJlfnV%2Bj2xm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
