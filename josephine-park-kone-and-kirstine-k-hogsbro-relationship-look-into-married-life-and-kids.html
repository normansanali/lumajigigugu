They make the decision not to make their children’s photos or bios public.</p><h2><span id=The_career_of_Josephine_Park>The career of Josephine Park</span></h2><p>Since beginning her acting career in 2009, Josephine has been in a number of well-known Danish TV programs, including “The Killing,” “Rita,” and “The Legacy.” Park has been in movies including “The Absent One” and “Steppeulven” in addition to plays like “Hamlet” and “The Nutcracker.”</p><p>The Danish Netflix series “Baby Fever,” in which Park plays Nynne, one of the major protagonists, has been Park’s most notable role to date.
