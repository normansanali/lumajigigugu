In reality, it is more of an unincorporated community and less of a town in Oklahoma. But that doesn’t lessen the fact that Loki season 2 has not chosen the place on some random whim."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Apart from becoming Sylvie’s vacation spot after murdering He Who Remains and diligently (but not so subtly) promoting McDonald’s? No, nothing, not yet at least. But as for its ties to the Marvel comics goes, it has quite a few big ones.</p><h2 id=h-is-there-a-broxton-oklahoma-in-marvel-comics-and-is-it-connected-to-loki data-injectable=false>Is there a Broxton, Oklahoma in Marvel Comics and is it connected to Loki?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sylvie-in-Broxton-Oklahoma-in-Loki-Season-2.jpg><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>You bet there is, so much so that the would-be town’s barely there Wikipedia page has its significance in the comics bulking up its entry a bit.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>So, the comics. In the comics by J. Michael Straczynski, Thor set up a new home for the Asgardians in 2007’s Thor #1 after they were reborn post perishing during the events of “Ragnarok” (2004), and the realm was temporarily destroyed.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>The Asgardians retained the place as their home for a while — even when Asgard itself was eventually hovering over Broxton — unlike the MCU where the new Asgard put up roots in Tønsberg, Norway.</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>Anyway, what is important is in the comics, Broxton doesn’t really get a happy ending after trying to keep up with literal gods living amongst its human residents. Ulik, the Asgardian troll with a dedicated vendetta against Thor, joins forces with the massive and powerful company Roxxon to destroy the town. While the tussle just wrecked Broxton, it was God Tempest, severely pissed by Thor, who decimated the town.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=598 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>As for Sylie’s connection to Broxton, Lady Loki is the form Loki took during his time in Broxton in the comic books. So, if Loki season 2 choosing Broxton, Oklahoma was a nifty little Easter egg, then great. It playing a bigger role than just being one of Sylvie’s many rest stops (before <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she joins forces with You Know Who to save Loki</a>) would also be welcome. But if not, if Asgardians setting up shop somewhere else doesn’t deter Marvel from picking points from the town’s appearance in its source material, here is hoping the MCU’s Broxton escapes its gory fate from the Marvel comics.</p><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=91 data-injectable=false>Loki season 2 is now airing on Disney Plus, with weekly episodes set to air every Thursday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedlr%2B3sctorqGZpGK2tHnToZxmq5mcu6qyyJyYp5uVYrynecGrprGsn6N6sLfLmp%2BopZFitq95y6iiomWjmq60u81maWaZnpl6qr%2BMoqtmmV2nsqK4jKmjmpuVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
