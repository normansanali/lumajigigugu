Television, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, the 20-year-old actor notified the studio and revealed he would not reprise his role in Season 3 due to "personal reasons." The studio also announced they would recast the role of Jonathan Kent.</p><p>Since then, there's been much speculation regarding his departure, with some assuming he left because he did not want to portray a bisexual character — Jonathan Kent came out as bisexual in the fifth issue of Superman: Son of Kal-El. However, those rumors were shut down once sources close to the production said Jordan's exit was "not a result of a workplace-related issue."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><p>In fact, Jordan's departure from Superman & Lois might have to do with something else. According to Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@BobaTalks</a>, the actor took to Instagram in June 2022 and disclosed in a since-deleted post that he was struggling with his mental health.</p><p>"I've been struggling recently with a number of things all pretty much revolving around mental health and well-being," he wrote in the caption alongside a screenshot of a poem he penned in the iPhone notes app.</p><p>Jordan added, "I'm headed to a facility for a month to get the mental health back on track, and get the tools I need so I can help myself, because right now I can't. For so long I felt weak, I felt like my problems weren't real and that everyone else's were bigger than mine. I felt that I needed to 'man up' and deal with it internally."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><p>"As you might imagine, things got progressively worse over the past couple of years. I'm finally ready to get help, and it's a huge, huge sacrifice. I barely have any time home to spend with my family and friends because I go back for Season 3 of Superman & Lois. But it's worth it. It's so worth it. I'm not just doing this for me, but I'm doing it for the people I love," he concluded.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michael Bishop is replacing Jordan Elsass in 'Superman & Lois.'</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheWrap</a>, Australian actor Michael Bishop is stepping in to take over the role of Jonathan Kent moving forward. You may recognize Michael from the 2021 tv movie Spin, the 2019 short Shelter, or from 2018's Grace Beside Me (in which he played Teddy in six episodes).</p><p>Season 3 of Superman & Lois premieres on the CW on March 14, 2023</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ain6exorqMnqOsmaOoeq2xwK%2BcZqulpbKzucCnZJqmlGK5sLXS</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
