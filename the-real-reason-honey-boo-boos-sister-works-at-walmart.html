Someone commented on her Instagram <a href=#>pic</a>, suggesting that Anna needs to push her way into Hollywood: "U need the right mgmt... You could do well in TV.. I really think you need to start branding yourself differently.. I love that [you're] a regular woman working a reg job but there's a place for u in Hollywood if u play the game right." But someone else responded by saying, "Maybe [s]he does not want to be in the limelight?"</p><p>Anna actually <a href=#>responded</a> to some of her Instagram followers, so when a fan asked how long she had worked at Walmart, she answered: "[I've] been there for 2 years." Even after her surgery, Anna didn't have long to recover before going back to work. In an interview with <a href=#>Hollywood Life</a>, Anna shared that she's a stocker at Walmart and her job involves some heavy-lifting. She was home resting for a week, but then went back in. She said, "I was scared to go to work, with the scarring, because I still had my tape on and I still had stitches."&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, nothing happened and she was given a lighter workload so she was able to heal safely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2hhZ4Z3e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2dvK%2Bx2GaZqKddl7ywv4ysoKyslad6uLvRpKpmmaRixKK4zJqprWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
