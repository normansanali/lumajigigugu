He<a href=#> made a name for himself following his time at Nickelodeon</a>, which included hit projects such as All That, Drake & Josh, Zoey 101, iCarly, Victorious and the Fairly Odd Parents film trilogy.</p><p>The musician <a href=#>continued to lend his voice over the years</a> to various animated shows and video games. Bell also appeared in many films including L.A. Slasher, American Satan and Cover Versions.</p><p>In August 2020, Bell’s personal life made headlines <a href=#>when his ex-girlfriend <strong>Melissa Lingafelt</strong> accused him</a> of abuse.</p><p>“First off I’d like to start out by saying I don’t really care if anyone believes me, as this is my story and my life and something that I went through. It wasn’t until recently that I actually realized that abuse isn’t something that all women have to go through,” she said in a series of TikTok videos.</p><p>In the lengthy social media uploads, Lingafelt <a href=#>recalled dating Bell from 2006 to 2009</a>. (She said she was 16 and Bell was 20 when they began their romantic relationship.)</p><p>“I was homeschooled, I moved in with him, I was singing,” she continued. “It wasn’t until about a year [into the relationship] when the verbal abuse started. And when I say verbal abuse, imagine the worst type of verbal abuse you could ever imagine, and that was what I got. It then turned into physical — hitting, throwing, everything. At the pinnacle of it, he drug [sic] me down the stairs of our house in Los Feliz, [California]. My face hit every step on the way down. I have photos of this.”</p><p>The Splash contestant<a href=#> denied Lingafelt’s allegations</a>, telling Variety that same month, “I never abused my ex-girlfriend or did so many of the other things Melissa falsely claimed on her TikTok video. As our relationship ended — more than a decade ago — we, unfortunately, both called each other terrible names, as often happens when couples are breaking up. But that is it.”</p><p>He continued, “Clearly, Melissa still felt close enough to me just last year that she was comfortable reaching out to ask me to provide her with financial support during a tough time (which I did). I do not know if today’s behavior is some kind of misguided quest for more money or attention. But I cannot and will not allow these offensive and defamatory allegations to go unchallenged and I am reviewing my legal options.”</p><p>Bell later pleaded <a href=#>guilty to two criminal counts of attempted child endangerment charges</a> and disseminating matter harmful to juveniles. In June 2021, the Sam & Cat alum was charged and he initially pleaded not guilty. He <a href=#>changed his plea to guilty for an alleged incident</a> that took place in December 2017 in Cleveland, Ohio, where he had a performance.</p><p>“Bell violated his duty of care and, in doing so, created a risk of harm to the victim,” <strong>Tyler Sinclair</strong>, spokesman for the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office, said in a statement at the pretrial hearing. “The investigation also revealed that months leading up to the concert, Bell sent the victim inappropriate social media messages.”</p><p>The California native <a href=#>was sentenced to two years of probation</a> one month later. “I just want to say today that I accept this claim because my conduct was wrong,” he said at the time. “I’m sorry that the victim was harmed in any way, but that was obviously not my intention. I take this matter very seriously, and again I just want to apologize to her and anyone else who may have been affected by my actions.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed that Bell was ordered to 200 hours of community service in addition to probation. He can’t have any contact with his victim and he ultimately <a href=#>did not have to register as a sex offender.</a></p><p>Amid his legal issues, Bell revealed that he previously <a href=#>married <strong>Janet Von Schmeling</strong> after five years of dating</a> and that they secretly welcomed a child in 2021. Bell and Schmeling ultimately parted ways in 2023 before he was reported missing.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In April 2023, the Daytona Beach Police Department <a href=#>confirmed they were searching for the “endangered” actor. </a>Bell was located hours after news of his disappearance made headlines.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to revisit Bell’s ups and downs through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksbOtyp5km52cocBuwc%2BsZJqmlGKxsMPNrGStoKKkwqi0jK2fnmWpmq6zv4ypn6isn6h8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
