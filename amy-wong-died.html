The initial caller reported hearing a gunshot, prompting an immediate police response. A second caller confirmed the deaths of a male and a female. <strong>Upon arrival, authorities discovered a female victim, identified as Amy Wong, who had succumbed to gunshot wounds in the business’s office area. Simultaneously, a male victim, later revealed to be Michael Wong, was found injured outside the company’s premises.</strong></p><p>Michael Wong was promptly transported to a nearby hospital for emergency care, but sadly, Amy Wong had already lost her life. The alleged perpetrator, discovered near the scene, had inflicted a fatal wound upon himself using a pistol found next to his lifeless body. <strong>The investigation revealed that after a heated verbal exchange with Amy, the suspect had shot her, proceeded outside, shot Michael Wong, and ultimately turned the gun on himself.</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Relationship_Dynamics></span>Relationship Dynamics:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Authorities disclosed that the male and female victims were potentially a married couple and were associated with the business.
