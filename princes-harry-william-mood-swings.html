However, just like anyone, the royals can lose their tempers sometimes and a royal expert explained to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=noopener>Daily Mail</a> that both Will and Harry are notorious for having hot heads. Robert Jobson, a former courtier, also noted that it's something that the brothers got from their mother, Princess Diana.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In private, the Duke of Cambridge has a notably short fuse. His fiery temper can blow up at any time — usually when he's frustrated or when it comes to issues regarding his family," Jobson wrote. "Even senior members of his circle will 'check which way the wind is blowing' before becoming too self-assured in his presence or raising problematic issues that might be better addressed at another time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They both have quite extreme mood swings, just as Diana did," he added. "She could be your best friend one minute and the next your worst enemy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And while the public will probably never see the two lose their composure, Jobson noted that Kate Middleton has — and she often had to act as a mediator between the two using her "deft diplomatic touch."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While there have been rumors of Harry <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>wanting a mediator</a> to get involved to help smooth over any familial drama, sources close to the Firm say that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noopener>it could be Kate</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If anyone can bring peace to the royals, Kate can. Kate is a brilliant arbiter and peacemaker," a source told Express. "Every bone in her body is about making friends and doing the best she can ... she is trying to mediate."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8%2BroKeblWK1or7RsmapqpmjsKa%2FjKGYq6qpYsSquMuimKZlnaS8pXnSsKCnn6M%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
