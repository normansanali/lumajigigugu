Recommended Videos Many films that aimed to tap into the teen market either were immediately forgotten upon release, or have aged as poorly as you might expect given two decades have passed since the 2000s. Bring It On is one of the rarities that has not only managed to withstand the test of time, but has only gained an even larger devoted fanbase as the years pass."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Bring It On is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the rarities</a> that has not only managed to withstand the test of time, but has only gained an even larger devoted fanbase as the years pass.</p><p data-characters=582 data-current-count=932 data-injectable=true>Part of what makes it so captivating is its willingness to address issues rarely seen in teen films even now, like racial inequality, cultural appropriation, and class inequality. Bring It On’s premise is of a wealthy, predominantly white school’s cheerleading team winning cheer championships by using cheers they stole from a predominantly Black cheerleading team from Compton — a story that feels just as relevant today as it did then. Bring It On was instantly labeled a classic, and it helped further the careers of actors like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabrielle Union</a> and Kirsten Dunst.</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>It’s no wonder Bring It On has inspired several sequels, the most recent being 2022’s Bring It On: Cheer or Die. Unlike the original, the sequels are not nearly as celebrated by fans; some like Bring It On: All or Nothing are relatively well-liked while others, like the aforementioned Cheer or Die, might be better to skip. However, if you desperately want to binge all seven Bring It On films, here’s how to watch them in order.</p><h2 id=h-bring-it-on-watch-order data-injectable=false>Bring It On watch order</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>Truthfully, the Bring It On films don’t have an order; none of the sequels actually tie in with the plot of the first film. Beyond being about cheerleading, the follow-ups have little in common and don’t share any cast members, characters, or settings. Unfortunately, those who want <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a direct sequel to the 2000 original </a>will have to wait with the rest of us.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>That said, the best watch order for most viewers is chronologically (though perhaps with a second watch of the original as a palate cleanser at the end).
