Broken out of the villain’s spell, he became one of the private eye’s most trusted allies, and the first season ended with him and Jessica seemingly opening Alias Investigations back up.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=173 data-injectable=false>It was the actor who confirmed his presence in The Defenders during a recent interview, though he made it clear that he has no idea how significant a role Malcolm will play.</p><p data-characters=589 data-current-count=762 data-injectable=true>Considering the fact that The Defenders <a href=#>is set to start shooting later this year</a>, it seems as if this show will follow Iron Fist and come before season three of Daredevil&nbsp;and second seasons for the rest of the team. Netflix’s insistence on sticking with just two Marvel series a year is still more than a little frustrating considering their popularity, and while we’re happy with what they’ve put out so far, they’re definitely going to have to up that number eventually in order to keep up with demand and avoid an eighteen month or two year gap between seasons.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>Regardless, watching&nbsp;<strong>The Defenders</strong> come together should be a lot of fun, and it will be interesting&nbsp;to see which other familiar faces end up being part of the team-up series in the coming months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yrsdKsoJyZXZ%2B8r7HSZqqtmaJisqytjJ2Yq66ZobmmecKopZ%2BhoqLAbr7Erayrpl2eu27Ax55knZ2WmrulsdGsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
