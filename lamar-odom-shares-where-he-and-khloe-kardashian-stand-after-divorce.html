Of course, at this time, we all know that we really have to do what’s best for us. And if they feel like that’s best for them, then they have my full support.”</p><p>The New York native, who previously starred on the spinoff Khloé & Lamar for two seasons, revealed that although <a href=#>he’s had his ups and downs</a> with the Revenge Looks Better Naked author, he would “love to remain her friend” once the dust settles.</p><p>“I’m proud of her and I wish her well,” Odom told Us, noting he is happy to see Kardashian thriving as a mother. “If she was able to take care of a 29-year-old man, I know she’d be great with a baby,” he joked.</p><p>The following month, Odom reflected on his time on KUWTK while <a href=#>rewatching his and Kardashian’s TV wedding</a>.</p><p>“My show with my ex wife ❤️ I want to thank @krisjenner @khloekardashian @kimkardashian @robkardashianofficial @kourtneykardash for taking me in and loving me without judgement,” he captioned an Instagram video of himself tuning in for the rerun in March. “Y’all gave me family and for that I am forever grateful 🙏🏾❤️.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kardashian has since moved on with <a href=#><strong>Tristan Thompson</strong></a>, with whom she shares 3-year-old daughter <a href=#>True</a>.</p><p>Odom, for his part, got engaged to <a href=#><strong>Sabrina Parr</strong></a> in November 2019.
