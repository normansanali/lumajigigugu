Astronauts</h3><p>Being an astronaut is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.</p><p>Spacewalk sounds wonderful, but the real stuff as an astronaut is not that fun. An astronaut at least has to stay up to 6 months in the space station performing scientific experiments on the human body and living in space.</p><p>Besides, space is lethal with cosmic radiation, which can cause long-term cancer risks and also can damage DNA.</p><p>According to NASA reports, spaceflight leads to increased exposure to zero gravity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SAstronaut.jpg><p>And thus, it comes with certain threats like motion sickness, weak immune system, bone, and muscle tissue loss.</p><p>Similarly, astronauts must live in isolation which results in sleepless nights and mental health problems.</p><p>Moreover, while on a mission to Mars or Moon, the astronauts face communication blackouts. It becomes hard to know and help them in threatening conditions from Earth.</p><p>Till now, 31 astronauts have died on the space mission. Apollo lunar astronauts have higher mortality rates due to cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>Though the job pays a pretty decent income, it takes a lot of courage and risks to be an astronaut.</p><h3>17. E-Waste Recyclers</h3><p>E-waste recycling job is another most <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dangerous job in the world.</a></p><p>With the rapid increase in the use of technology, new kinds of waste (electronic waste) like computers, cell phones, circuit boards, etc., are also increasing.</p><p>E-waste is one of the major global problems. Every year, the world produces more than 65.4 million tonnes of e-waste.</p><p>Millions of individuals worldwide are engaged as e-waste recyclers. They informally collect, repair, renovate, dismantle, recycle, and dispose of the e-waste under harmful working conditions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/E-Waste-Recyclers.jpg><p>While trying to take out reusable parts from the e-wastes like a hard drive or precious metals (gold, silver) to earn some good income, they often risk their lives and the environment.</p><p>E-waste recyclers are prone to suffer from serious health damages caused by toxic substances like mercury, lead, lithium, barium, etc. These potent toxins lead to brain, heart, liver, and kidney damages.</p><h3>16. Underground Welder</h3><p>The job of the underwater welder is challenging but has high demand and pays pretty good. Similarly, being an underground welder is not that easy. One must have extensive training and experience in scuba diving and welding.</p><p>Underwater welders maintain and repair marine structures. They repair oil drilling rigs, underwater pipelines, dams, ships, and nuclear power facilities. Their job location might vary from lakes, rivers, dams to deepest offshores.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Underground-Welders.jpg><p>What makes the job of underground welders dangerous is they might face risks of electric shock, decompression sickness, and hypothermia.</p><p>Besides, changes in water pressure can also result in drowning. Moreover, wet welding produces oxygen and hydrogen gases which, when becomes concentrated, lead to an explosion.</p><p>Each year 11 underground welders die due to drowning.</p><h3>15. Alaskan Crab Fisherman</h3><p>Alaska is home to the sweet and extremely tender crab species, King Crab.</p><p>The crab fishermen go for hunting valuable king crabs in the Gulf of Alaska, mainly in the Bering Sea. As the peak season for the Alaskan crabs is mostly during winter, the fishermen have to face the roughest conditions.</p><p>During winter, the Bering Sea is ruthless. Wild cool storms roar around the heavy sea. Similarly, the temperature drops below the freezing point, and the ice covers the whole boat making it slippery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Alaskan-Crab-Fishermen.jpg><p>The Alaskan crab fisherman has to face all these challenges and stay alert.</p><p>In the midst of the uncertainty and raging sea, they have to put bait on a 360 kg crab pot supported by a crane, throw them underwater, and pull it on the right catch.</p><p>Besides, they must keep on hitting to break the ice so that the boat doesn’t sink.</p><p>Moreover, tiredness during the job and a single distraction can lead to accidents from heavy machinery. Further, the dropping temperature can result in hypothermia.</p><p>While the violent sea and weather may drive the fishermen overboard.</p><p>300 crab fishermen have died till now due to drowning and hypothermia.</p><h3>14. Loggers</h3><p>The job of loggers is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.</p><p>Loggers harvest the trees by using chainsaws and other effective equipment like feller bunchers.
