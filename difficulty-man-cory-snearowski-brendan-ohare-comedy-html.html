It tracks Difficulty Man’s journey as he goes to the beach every year to collect free sand (“a far superior seasoning to salt or pepper”), crusade against lifeguards (a.k.a. “those who try to play God by learning the dark art of CPR”), and seek out a searching companion he believes once sent him a personalized message in a bottle. The personalized message? A Wawa receipt that reads, “Thank you! Please come back soon!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7ao6a6z001j3b6v5lhn2wc3@published data-word-count=104>The video is Snearowski and O’Hare at their finest, showcasing the comedic quirks that vocal fan <a href=#>Tim Heidecker</a> became enamored with before he decided to attach his production company, Abso Lutely, to the duo’s narrative podcast. “I think there’s a lot of funny people, or people who think they’re funny, who think they can tie a bunch of non sequiturs together and improvise to create an absurd conversation,” he <a href=#>told us of the pair in 2019</a>. “But theirs has a thoughtfulness to it. There are some surprises to it. They’re just both very likable right away, too. The whole thing feels kind of timeless.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7ao6a70001k3b6vho2wkikt@published data-word-count=45>This Is Branchburg, which has featured the voice-acting talents of everyone from <a href=#>Tim Robinson </a>to <a href=#>Ezra Koenig</a>, wrapped its second season in December 2020 and has yet to return. Here’s hoping they heed the immortal words of Wawa receipts everywhere and “please come back soon.”</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjwktk2az00c30vy6c6ty9c8t@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Tim Heidecker Highly Recommends You Visit Branchburg</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjldwb5u4002n1ty6b9j2rwgu@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Branchburg: Wildy, Wonderfully Weird</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Go on the Weirdest Vacation Ever With Difficulty Man</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpa2dgbXyltcWfoJytnKnGbrnAp2Scp6KuerS6xJqpqK%2BjoLZurtGepZ2ZnmK8qa3RnmScp52asbp6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
