I trust that investigation to be fair, thorough, and just.”</p><p>"By formally requesting that BCI handle this initial investigation, we are following what I believe to be best practice and which many communities across the country are now doing," said Mylett.</p><p>"Utilizing an independent entity to conduct the investigation will be a further step in increasing trust and accountability with our citizens.”</p><p>Deputy Mayor Marco Sommerville said that releasing the footage is a change that the community "has been requesting for decades."</p><p>"From here, we need to be patient and allow that investigation to run its course. I'm urging peace for our city throughout this process."</p><h2>AKRON POLICE AND MAYOR RESPOND TO SHOOTING</h2><p>Horrigan and Mylett released a joint statement on June 29 in response to the shooting.</p><p>“We know that no police officer ever wants to discharge their service weapon in the line of duty. And anytime they must, it's a dark day for our city, for the families of those involved, as well as for the officers," the statement begins.</p><p>"Tragically, we are once again faced with a young man, with his life before him, gone too soon. Every single life is precious, and the loss of any life is absolutely devastating to our entire community.</p><p>"Our prayers are with Jayland Walker’s loved ones, and we offer our sincere condolences to all those who knew him. Our thoughts are also with our Akron police officers and their families.</p><p>The statement continues, reassuring citizens that the body cam footage would be released in the coming days.</p><p>"We are keeping our promise to the community, understanding that there can be no trust without transparency and follow-through on commitment.</p><p>"We have every confidence in the Attorney General's Bureau of Criminal Investigation to conduct a thorough, fair, and honest investigation.
