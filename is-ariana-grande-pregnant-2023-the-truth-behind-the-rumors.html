The Truth Behind The Rumors</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-28</div><p>Ariana Grande is one of the most popular and successful pop stars in the world. She has won numerous awards, sold millions of albums, and broken several records with her catchy songs and impressive vocals. She is also known for her personal life, which has been the subject of much media attention and speculation. Recently, some fans have been wondering if Ariana Grande is pregnant 2023, based on some clues and hints they have noticed in her latest album and music videos. But is there any truth to these rumors?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Positions Album and Music Videos</strong></p><p>The rumors about Ariana Grande’s pregnancy started after she released her sixth studio album, Positions, in October 2020. The album features lyrics and visuals that could be interpreted as being suggestive of a pregnancy or a desire to have a baby. For example, in the song “34+35”, Ariana sings “Can you stay up all night?/F–k me ’til the daylight”, which some fans have taken as a reference to conception. In the music video for “Positions”, Ariana is seen cradling her stomach in a way that could be seen as indicative of a pregnancy. She also wears a white dress that resembles a wedding gown, implying that she is ready to settle down and start a family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Secret Wedding with Dalton Gomez</strong></h2><p>Another factor that fueled the rumors about Ariana Grande’s pregnancy was her secret wedding with Dalton Gomez, a real estate agent whom she started dating in January 2020. The couple got engaged in December 2020 and tied the knot in May 2021 in an intimate ceremony at Ariana’s home in Montecito, California. The wedding was attended by only 20 guests, mostly close family and friends. Ariana looked stunning in a strapless silk dress by Vera Wang, accessorized with pearl and diamond earrings by Lorraine Schwartz. Some fans speculated that the reason why Ariana and Dalton had such a low-key wedding was because they wanted to keep their pregnancy a secret.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Reactions from Other Celebrities and Influencers</strong></h2><p>Many celebrities and influencers have weighed in on the potential news of Ariana Grande’s pregnancy. Some have expressed their excitement and support for the pop star, while others have been more skeptical and doubtful. For example, Taylor Swift tweeted “I’m so excited for you if this is true!” while Halsey posted a series of heart emojis in response to the rumors. On the other hand, James Charles tweeted “Ariana Grande pregnant? I’m not convinced yet.” Some fans have also pointed out that Ariana has been busy with her professional projects, such as her stint as a coach on The Voice, which could make it difficult for her to be pregnant.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Verdict: Is Ariana Grande Pregnant 2023?</strong></h2><p>Based on the available evidence, it seems that there is no concrete proof that Ariana Grande is pregnant 2023 or has ever tried to conceive. The rumors are based on assumptions and interpretations that are not confirmed or denied by Ariana or her team. Therefore, it is best to respect Ariana’s privacy and not spread false or misleading information about her personal life. Ariana has always been vocal about her love for music and her fans, and she deserves to enjoy her married life with Dalton without being subjected to unnecessary speculation. If and when Ariana decides to share any news about her pregnancy or her plans to have a baby, we will be happy to celebrate with her. Until then, we can only admire her talent and wish her all the best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBurdGimKeZXZy%2ForrDnmSpqpWcu6K602ZpaWpjYsGpsYytqa6smGKvprTIp5tmrJiaerPBzKiprGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
