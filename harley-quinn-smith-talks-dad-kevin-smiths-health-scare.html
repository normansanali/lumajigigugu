It took that happening to make him open to it. Although it was horrible and beyond scary for all of us, we kind of think it’s a good thing now because it could’ve gone absolutely the other way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harley-Quinn-Smith-Opens-Up-About-Dad-Kevin-Smith-Health-Scare-01.jpg><p>Smith, 49, suffered a massive heart attack in February 2018. The Clerks director shared the news with his Twitter followers with a photo of himself hooked up to tubes and laying in a hospital bed.</p><p>“After the first show this evening, I had a massive heart attack,” he wrote. “The Doctor who saved my life told me I had 100% blockage of my LAD artery (aka “the Widow-Maker”). If I hadn’t canceled show 2 to go to the hospital, I would’ve died tonight. But for now, I’m still above ground!”</p><p>In May 2018, the Comic Book Men star revealed in an exclusive interview with Us that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he didn’t realize he was having a heart attack</a> because he had been smoking marijuana two hours prior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harley-Quinn-Smith-Opens-Up-About-Dad-Kevin-Smith-Health-Scare-02.jpg><p>“Even though they tell me I had a heart attack, I didn’t feel like I was in pain, so I never panicked,” Smith explained. “I was super f—king calm. After I got out of the hospital, I said [to my doctor], ‘Hey man, I hate to admit this, but I was blazed as f—k the day I had the heart attack … Does smoking weed have something to do with a heart attack?’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since his heart attack, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith has made his health a priority.</a> He told Us in February that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has lost 58 pounds </a>through WW (formerly known as Weight Watchers). He added that his <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> journey wasn’t about his appearance but was strictly to improve his health.</p><p>“I just want to stress to those out there who care, it was never about dropping the weight. I wasn’t sitting there like ‘I wanna look good!’” he told Us. “It was about ‘Get this out of your system.’”</p><p>With reporting by Taylor Ferber</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmaKhsrp50K6gp6ZdqLqqwMdmq5qkm6h6pa3DZqKerpmjerS5yK2frGWYmq6twMdmqpyZopp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
