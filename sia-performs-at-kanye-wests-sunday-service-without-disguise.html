Kanye West did not let a rainstorm put a damper on his church service in Los Angeles on Sunday, May 19 — and Sia joined in on the fun as well.
The Australian singer, 43, ditched her classic disguise of a wig covering her face and took the stage at the indoor worship session to perform a gospel version of her hit song “Elastic Heart.” Kim Kardashian posted videos of the surprise performance on her Instagram Stories."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

No mics, no band, no speakers but it was perfect. Not a dry eye in the room today.”</p><p>The KKW Beauty founder added, “The choir sang Sia’s ‘Elastic Heart’ song and changed the words to a gospel song.”</p><p>The Grammy nominee wore an all-blue workout ensemble, put her hair in a messy bun and sang, “Lift up your voices now / Sing praises onto God,” to the tune of “Elastic Heart,” as the choir and worshippers cheered. She continued, “Offer it all to him / he is the morning sun.”</p><p>Sia explained why she wears her signature look on The Late Late Show With James Corden in February 2016. “I was a singer for 10 or 11 years to mediocre success. I was an alcoholic and a drug addict,” she said. “I sobered up, and I decided I didn’t want to be an artist anymore, because I was starting to get a little bit famous and it was destabilizing in some way. I thought, ‘What doesn’t exist in pop music at the moment?’ And it was mystery. I was like, there’s pictures on Instagram of everyone at the dentist.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Selfish author <a href=#>opened up about West’s weekly church service in April</a>, calling it a “healing experience” for him. “It’s just music, there’s no sermon,” the <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> star told Elle. “It’s definitely something he believes in, Jesus, and there’s a Christian vibe. But there’s no preaching. It’s just a very spiritual Christian experience.”</p><p>The reality TV personality added that the service is open to all faiths: “Everyone that comes understands it’s just a really healing experience with an amazing choir and amazing messages about love to start off your week.”</p><p>West and Kardashian <a href=#>welcomed their fourth child together</a>, a <a href=#>son named Psalm</a>, on May 9. They also share 5-year-old daughter <a href=#>North</a>, 3-year-old son <a href=#>Saint</a> and 16-month-old daughter <a href=#>Chicago</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqimV2lsrOyzqukrGWRqXqsrc2ynGavlajBtHnSrqWdmaliwKa%2B1aKanmWnnsGpu9StZJ2ho5zCqr%2FEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
