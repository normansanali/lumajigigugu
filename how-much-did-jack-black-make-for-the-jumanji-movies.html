It is rare to see a successful film turn into a successful franchise, but once it happens, there is simply no looking back. While the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MCU</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DC</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Bond</a> all make bank, other franchises have developed and found their place at the box office, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The modern&nbsp;Jumanji franchise has been rolling, with two successful films thus far. The original flick came out in the 90s, but once a modern spin was put on things, it reached an entirely different level. This, of course, means that lead performers like Jack Black have been raking in the dough.</p><p>Let’s see how much Jack Black made for the&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;films.</p><h2 id=he-made-5-million-for-welcome-to-the-jungle>He Made $5 Million For Welcome To The Jungle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/B5E13D71-192D-4F90-8CAC-78C74B611C67.jpeg><p>Back in 2017,&nbsp;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle as set to hit theaters, and there was some skepticism about how the film would perform. It had been years since the original film was released, and despite having famous faces like Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black, there was simply no guarantee that the movie would be a hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the film, Jack Black was cast as the character Professor Oberon, and the interesting twist to the character was the Black was going to have the personality of a teenage girl. We have seen the performer excel in comedy roles throughout his career, and the folks that made the choice to cast Black in the role must have known that he would be a perfect fit.</p><p>For his performance in the movie, Jack Black was paid a reported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$5 million</a>. This is a nice chunk of change, especially considering that he was not playing the lead in the film. His role as a comedic secondary character got him plenty of time on screen and plenty of money in his account.</p><p>Eventually, the film would go on to gross over $900 million at the box office, becoming one of the biggest hits of the year. People really seemed to like what the movie brought to the table, and they especially liked the chemistry that the cast had with one another. The massive success of the film immediately got people wondering if another chapter would be made, and the studio wasted no time in getting it off the ground.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ice-T Posts About Kevin Hart’s Struggles With Taxation, As A Lesson For All</a></span></p><h2 id=he-pocketed-3-million-for-the-next-level>He Pocketed $3 Million For The Next Level</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8657EBA3-1133-4360-8379-11687FFB99D9.jpeg><p>Despite all of the success that&nbsp;Welcome to the Jungle had, some people wondered if there was need for another flick. The stories of the characters seemed to end pretty well in the first one, and tampering with things does not always work out for the best. Nevertheless, a second&nbsp;Jumanji film went into production in a hurry.</p><p>Two years later,&nbsp;Jumanji: The Next Level was all set to hit theaters with the hope that it could make a fortune at the box office. This time around, Black would be Oberon once again, but he would also be using the personality of a few different characters. This was a nice new ripple that was added to the script, and it gave Black some more room to have fun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It has been reported that Black was paid <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3 million</a> for his performance in the second film. Now, there would normally be a increase in pay when taking part in a sequel, but this was not the case here. It is possible that there was a backend deal worked out behind the scenes, which could have netted him a ton of money.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Box Office Mojo,&nbsp;The Next Level would go on to gross&nbsp;$800 million worldwide. This was another huge success for the studio, and while it was less than its predecessor, it proved that the franchise had staying power.</p><p>With two successful films in the bag, there has been some curiosity as to whether we could see a third modern installment in the franchise.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Of The Shortest Men In Hollywood</a></span></p><h2 id=will-there-be-another-jumanji>Will There Be Another Jumanji?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DFBBAAB3-AF8D-499F-8C0E-FC4EEBE53C9B.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of now, it has been confirmed that there will be another&nbsp;Jumanji film coming down the pipe. This is excellent news for both fans and the actors involved in the franchise, and it will have the potential to make a ton once theaters are up and running once again.</p><p>When speaking with&nbsp;Collider, writer and director Jake Kasdan would say, “We were just getting into the conversation before this global calamity, and we will re-engage it as soon as everybody's settled. We all love working together and we've loved making these.”</p><p>It’s still early in the process, so it could be a long time before we get another&nbsp;Jumanji film. This won’t stop fans from generating hype for what should be a fun flick.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They Got Paid How Much!?
