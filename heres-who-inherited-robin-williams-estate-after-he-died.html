According to&nbsp;Susan Schneider Williams,&nbsp;she blocked them from her Tiburon home because they gave her little notice, and the request came soon after Williams' death. However, Williams' children claimed that she let others into the home around this time. Some of the personal belongings in dispute were Robin Williams' awards, including his Academy Award for his work in "Good Will Hunting"; his collection of action figures, movie posters, and graphic novels; as well as photographs, roughly 50 bicycles, and even slippers.</p><p dir=ltr>The opposing sides eventually reached a settlement in October 2015. Schneider Williams received items with sentimental value, such as wedding gifts she and her late husband received when they married in 2011 (via the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>). "I feel like Robin's voice has been heard, and I can finally grieve in the home we shared together," she said in a statement (via <a href=#>The New York Times</a>). None of Williams' children publicly commented on the case, but their attorney, Meredith Bushnell, said that they "were relieved to have this behind them" (via <a href=#>People</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCClmlscWpfnbKzsdJmrqGnXZ67qbHRoquenF2nvKO1zWauoqScnq6uv4yeqq2ZpJp6orLTnqlmoJVisaqxw2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
