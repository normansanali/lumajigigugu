After Polestar 1 and 2, people are very excited about the new Polestar 3, which is due out in October of this year. Polestar 3 is entering a very competitive market—the niche for electric SUVs—with high hopes.</p><p>The Polestar 3 will be made in Volvo’s factory in Ridgeville, South Carolina, for the American market. This shows that Polestar wants to be a strong competitor in the segment. There is a lot to look forward to when the Polestar 3 comes out in October of this year. This news article is full of useful information about Polestar 3.</p><p>In this up-to-date news story, you can find out everything we know so far about Polestar 3.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li class="is-title post-title"><a href=#>The Owl House Season 2 Episode 14: Release Date Status, Time, Spoiler and More info!</a></li><li class="is-title post-title"><a href=#>How Rob Kardashian Lost 50 Pounds: How Did He Do It? Full Transformation Journey!</a></li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Polestar 3 Release Date Details</h2><p>Polestar has said that the Polestar 3 will come out in <strong>October 2022</strong>, and they will start taking orders on the first day. At first, the car won’t have all of the available technology. Things like self-driving on the highway will be added later, probably through a software update.</p><p>The Polestar 3 is expected to go into production at the start of 2023. Hertz has ordered over 65,000 Polestar EVs, which may include the Polestar 3. It is not clear if everyone will be able to get their hands on the car so soon.</p><h2>Price Of Polestar 3</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Price-Of-Polestar-3.jpg alt="Price Of Polestar 3" width=622 height=350 sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p>The Polestar 3 doesn’t have a set price yet, but Thomas Ingenlath, the CEO of Polestar, has given some hints about how much it will cost.</p><p>In particular, he said that they want to compete with Porsche and that the Porsche Cayenne will go up against the Polestar 3.</p><p>If we use that as a guide, the base price of the Polestar 3 will be between $70,000 and $80,000. This is because the Cayenne and Cayenne Coupé are priced in the same range, even though they aren’t electric.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Polestar 3 Design</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Polestar-3-Design.jpg alt="Polestar 3 Design" width=1700 height=1132 sizes="(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>On Polestar’s website, there is an official photo of the Polestar 3, but it only shows the outside of the car. It shows an SUV with a slightly sloping roof and a spoiler on the back. These details put the “sport” in “Sport Utility Vehicle.”</p><p>Since the roofline doesn’t slope as much as a BMW X6, Audi Sportback Coupé, or Porsche Cayenne Coupé, it’s likely that this design was chosen to make more room for cargo. The “Thor headlights,” which are similar to those on Volvos, are also there, and the back has a taillight bar.</p><p>The outside design has a lot in common with the Polestar Precept, which is what Polestar’s head of design, Maximilian Missoni, said would be the case for many design features. This helps us picture what the inside of the Polestar 3 will look like. There are no official pictures of the interior design yet.</p><p>The design will probably be like the Polestar Precept, which has a screen in the middle that is aligned vertically and another screen behind the wheel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Polestar 3 Specs</h2><p>Polestar has given a lot of information about the drivetrain and range, as well as a few interesting facts, but that’s it. In its most recent press release, Polestar confirmed that it will have a “best-in-class” LiDAR sensor from Luminar and a big battery that will give it a range of 372 miles (WLTP).</p><p>The first Polestar 3s will have a drivetrain with two motors. In the future, a single motor option, likely with front-wheel drive, will be available. The Polestar will not have seven seats like its sister car, the Volvo XC90. However, the Polestar 3 will be built on the same platform as the next-generation XC90. This platform is called SPA2.</p><p>The next-generation Snapdragon hardware will power Google’s operating system and run the infotainment system.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Technical Specifications</h2><p>No numbers, other than the range, have been made public. Aside from a big battery and a range of 372 miles, it’s hard to guess how fast the car is because we don’t know how much power it has or how much torque it has.</p><p>Since the Polestar 3 wants to compete in the premium electric SUV market, it makes sense that the numbers will be close to those of the competition. If we look at a relatively new electric SUV like the BMW iX, which has the same range as the Polestar 3, we might expect it to have a similar performance, like going from 0 to 60 in less than five seconds.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Technical-Specifications.jpg alt="Technical Specifications" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Using the same line of thinking, the Polestar 3 should have at least 500 horsepower and more than 700 torque. This is true for the first Polestar 3 with two motors and is similar to the BMW iX xDrive 50. The CEO of Polestar said that over time, a less powerful Polestar 3 will come out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Polestar 3 News</h2><p>Since the official release is coming up soon (in October this year), most of the details will be known by then.</p><p>It is less likely that there will be more details and hints until then. Still, you can be sure that we will write about something new and interesting if it happens.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li class="is-title post-title"><a href=#>Samsung Galaxy S23 Release Date Status Rumors: Price, Specs, Early Rumors, And What We Want To See</a></li><li class="is-title post-title"><a href=#>MacBook Pro 2022 Release Date Status, Price, Design, And Feature And Here’s What We Know</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVflsK1u8yomaKklWS9sLjErKuaql1oerOxy56YrJ1dma61sYxrZmttZmyCcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
