According to Kay, there’s only one place to put the signs and that’s in the trash!</p><p>“If you put a sign up on your property that says ‘Beware of Dog,’ that means you know that your dog is potentially aggressive, potentially could attack somebody, and therefore it could make you liable for anything that happens,” she said in the video.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kay_guzman98 href=#>@kay_guzman98</a><p>Or no trespassing signs!

She found this out when she was considering purchasing one of her own.</p><p>“Not that our dogs are scary, but just to deter people from trying to come into our house or break into our house,” the TikToker explained. “When I talked to my family about it, they were like, ‘Whoa, no, no, no. Don't do that. You will be basically admitting that your dog is aggressive and not safe.’”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A lawyer said to never post signs that says Beware of Dog because you can be held liable if your dog bites someone. 👀</p>— Among the Wildflowers (@deaflibertarian) <a href=#>March 3, 2023</a></figure><p>She further pleaded her case: “If you're worried about people coming in — [it’s] better it be a surprise that your dog is aggressive and it attacks them then [for] you to put a sign that says ‘Beware of Dog’ that could make you liable for any attacking or whatever aggressive behavior your dog does.”</p><p>Sometimes, "Beware of Dog" signs are put up even when a dog isn’t aggressive, just as a courtesy to visitors. It’s those dog owners, Kay said, that should take heed of her advice the most.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“If you're thinking about getting a 'Beware of Dog' sign or you already have a 'Beware of Dog' sign, get rid of it,” Kay added. She advised that pet owners get a security camera or private property signs instead. “Please just like save your a--.”</p><p>The video, which quickly gained popularity online, was news to plenty of pet-owning TikTokers, who had no idea that the sign could be that problematic.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@@kay_guzman9</a></figure><p>However, some skeptics questioned Kay’s logic.</p><p>One commenter wrote: “In the United States, signs in plain view release the homeowner of liability from those who ignore them. [It] seems backward to be liable for having signage.”</p><p>Every city, state, and country has different laws for dog owners — so if you’re worried, it’s probably best that you do your own research before you make your next move!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbxuus6tZK6rlWKvpsPAq5xmp5ZisbCzjKygoKaj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
