She wore a tan blazer over a white shirt and black sweater, jeans and black sandals. In addition to accessorizing her look with a beige bag, gold jewelry and sunglasses, Watts was seen wearing what looks like <a href=#>a large diamond ring</a> on her left hand.</p><p>Us Weekly has reached out to reps for both stars for comment.</p><p>The Mulholland Drive actress’ outing comes two months after she posted a sweet selfie with the <a href=#>Almost Famous</a> star via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on <a href=#>Valentine’s Day</a>. “My darling ♥️,” she captioned the pic.</p><p>Watts — <a href=#>who shares kids</a> Sasha, 15, and Kai, 14, with her ex <a href=#><strong>Liev Schreiber</strong></a> — and Crudup were first linked in 2017 after playing husband and wife on the short-lived <a href=#>Netflix</a> series <a href=#>Gypsy</a>. News of their relationship came one year after the King Kong actress and Schreiber, 55, <a href=#>called it quits after 11 years together</a>.</p><p>“I feel, whether you’re famous or not, transitions are scary for anybody,” Watts said of the split in a <a href=#>November 2016 interview</a> with Australia’s Daily Telegraph. “I feel like change is always scary, but that’s only because transition for anyone is new, and you wonder how things are going to go.”</p><p>Us confirmed in August 2017 the Impossible star and Crudup <a href=#>were dating</a>, as a source exclusively noted that “they’re very into each other.” They made their <a href=#>red carpet debut</a> a few years later at the <a href=#>2022 Screen Actors Guild Awards</a>, at which <a href=#>Crudup was nominated</a> for Best Male Actor in a Drama Series for his role on Apple TV+’s <a href=#>The Morning Show</a>.</p><p>The couple have remained relatively private over the years, though they have stepped out publicly several times at events such as the <a href=#>2022 Primetime Emmy Awards</a>, the October 2022 launch of Watt’s wellness and beauty brand, <a href=#>Stripes</a>, and the premiere of Crudups’ new TV show Hello Tomorrow! in February.</p><p>Schreiber, for his part, has also <a href=#>found new love</a> with girlfriend <strong>Taylor Neisen</strong> and has remained friendly with the Australia native since their breakup. “You build a life with someone and things change. And I think the way we’ve looked at it is that <a href=#>we’ll always be partners</a> and that’s what kind of keeps us together and keeps us amicable,” the Ray Donovan alum told Porter Edit in 2017. “But I think we’re more than that. I think we also genuinely really care about each other.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former partners were on great terms in August 2022, as they and their respective partners <a href=#>came together to celebrate</a> Kai’s middle school graduation. “Congratulations to Kai ⚡️🎉,” Watts captioned a photo of her blended family via <a href=#>Instagram</a> at the time. “Class of 2022 #modernfamily ❤️ #graduation.”</p><p>Scroll below for photos of Watt’s ring:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNku6K7zKJksJmkqcBursilo7Jlk6fCpcHPZqqpmaKgeqa6xpqenqWVo8Fuv8%2Bemq6kkam2sLqMq6Cnn12ltqR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
