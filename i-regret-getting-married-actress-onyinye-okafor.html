The only regret I’d have had would have been wrong marriage but it still helped me to be who I am today. So, I don’t have even one regret. I am a proud mother of four lovely boys.&nbsp; I have also had lots of challenges in Nollywood. Some producers will tell you that if you don’t sleep with them, you won’t amount to anything in the industry. I was asked to have s3x with them in exchange for movie scripts many times and I did not do it! It is not something you come to say somebody did this or that to you.”</p><p>Onyinye Okafor in a recent interview monitored by Kemi Filani, also criticized her mates in the movie industry&nbsp;who air their personal grievances in public, particularly on social media.</p><p>She said: “He or she who feel that washing his/her dirty linen outside is best, should continue. For me, Onyi Okafor, it’s not my thing. I let you see what I want you to see. You cannot know too much about me because I’m not comfortable with that.</p><p>It is crazy and it’s not a good idea. I don’t know why people do such stupid and crazy thing. It’s not my thing. When I see things like that, I just pass like I don’t want to see it.</p><p>Except for death threat, every other thing should be about you. Like what you see on my page is me, I am the public person. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqJkq52Xp7K1ecaeq62hnpx6rq3Rq6CenF2WsLW%2BxKyqZqeerravxcRmpqSZlqS%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
