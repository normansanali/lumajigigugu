This means he would be coaching the Trojans for a whole decade! And guess what? They promised to pay him $110 million for these 10 years. That’s a lot of money! In fact, it makes him the top-earning coach in college football. He’s number one!</p><p>Now, let’s break it down a bit. Every year, from this big contract, Lincoln gets $10 million. This is called his base salary. It’s like the fixed amount he earns no matter what happens.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Lincoln_Rileys_Salary_Breakdown><strong>Lincoln Riley’s Salary Breakdown</strong></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td>Base Salary</td><td>$10 million per year</td></tr><tr><td>Signing Bonus</td><td>$1 million</td></tr><tr><td>Pac-12 Championship</td><td>$50,000</td></tr><tr><td>College Football Playoff</td><td>$1 million</td></tr><tr><td>National Championship</td><td>$2 million</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Lincoln_Riley8217s_Contract_Bonuses_And_Incentives><strong>Lincoln Riley’s Contract Bonuses And Incentives</strong></span></h2><p>There are special rewards or “bonuses” in his contract. For example, if his team wins the Pac-12 championship, he gets an extra $500,000. If they play in the big College Football Playoff, he earns another $1 million. And if they become the champions of the whole nation? Lincoln takes home an added $2 million! That’s like getting a huge gold star for doing a super job.</p><p>Now, the contract doesn’t just stop at money. Lincoln gets some cool extras too. He has a private jet he can use. They also gave him a fancy car to drive. And when he first signed the contract, they gave him a big bonus of $1 million just to say, “Welcome!”</p><p>Why is USC giving him so much? Well, they believe in him. They think he’s the key to making their team champions again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Lincoln_Riley8217s_Salary_Rise_Over_the_Years><strong>Lincoln Riley’s Salary Rise Over the Years</strong></span></h2><p>Lincoln Riley is a college football head coach. His pay has risen a lot over the years.</p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td>2017-2018</td><td>$3.1 million</td></tr><tr><td>2019-2020</td><td>$4.8 million</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>$6.4 million</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>$11 million</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>This jump in his salary shows that he is doing an excellent job and his team values him a lot.

So, let’s have a look at the same.</p><p>Riley has been an exceptional coach for the teams he has been a coach with. He has already led his team to win five conference titles, along with the College Football Playoff twice in six seasons. Apart from this, he is also a good teacher who has brought up some iconic players like, Baker Mayfield, Jalen Hurts, and Kyler Murray.</p><p>So, according to these achievements, Riley’s salary seems a good draft for the USC Trojans. Also, during the draft, Riley already had many other team offers, so USC had to pay him this price.</p><p>But, some people disagree with this, as Lincoln Riley is yet to win a National Championship. They think the team should invest in some other parts of the team which would lead them to grow in coming years like better players and facilities.</p><p><strong>Recommended For You:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Caleb Williams Bio: Age, Height, Weight, Hometown, Career, College, Family and more</a></p><p><a href=#>Who are Caleb Williams’ parents, Dayne Price and Carl Williams</a></p><p><a href=#>Caleb Williams Ethnicity and Nationality: Tracing the USC QB’s Roots</a></p><p><a href=#>Caleb Williams’ Academics: GPA, Major, and Future Plans</a></p><p><a href=#>Bo Nix’s Parents: Meet Krista and Patrick Nix</a><span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FtcbHoq2eZpOkunCvzqWjnp%2BVYrOwu9ObmKWkX6G2r6%2FOpaVmqpmhsrp50pqjmqqpYq6vsIycpqesopawtXnDnquaoZyofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
