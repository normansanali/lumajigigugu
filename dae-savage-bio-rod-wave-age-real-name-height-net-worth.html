S–t not fair — [y’all] don’t even care who y’all hurt wit dat s–t.”</p><p>In addition to posting the video of Daeja and Rod, @edit_luhwill also engaged Daeja in a text conversation in which she demanded that the video be removed. “Nah, cause you getting me in trouble with my man,” Daeja wrote, adding, “B–h I’m doing an interview with him for my YouTube. I got a whole [n-word] and you lying on me on TikTok.”</p><p>She threatened to shut down the page if bribery failed.
