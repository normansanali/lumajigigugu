During a roundtable conversation for The Hollywood Reporter, Fanning recalled losing out on a film opportunity at 16 years old because she was deemed “unfuckable.”
“I was very protected, I have an amazing manager and agent who’ve been with me since I was 8 or 9, same people, which is [rare] … and I recognize that,” she said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She noted that her manager’s protection extended to filtering out “damaging comments” that may have hurt her when she was younger.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’ve never told this story, but I was trying out for a movie. I didn’t get it. I don’t even think they ever made it, but it was a father-daughter road trip comedy,” she continued. “I didn’t hear from my agents because they wouldn’t tell me things like this—that filtration system is really important because there’s probably a lot more damaging comments that they filtered—but this one got to me. I was 16 years old, and a person said, ‘Oh, she didn’t get the father-daughter road trip comedy because she’s unfuckable.’”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added, “It’s so disgusting.

I’ll look at paparazzi photos from when I was 12 and think, ‘Is that a good thing to see such a mirror of yourself at that age?’ I don’t feel like it damaged me, but it definitely made me very aware of myself.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fanning has since gone on to star in movies like Maleficent, Teen Spirit, and All the Bright Places, as well as earn an Emmy nomination for her lead role in Hulu’s The Great.
