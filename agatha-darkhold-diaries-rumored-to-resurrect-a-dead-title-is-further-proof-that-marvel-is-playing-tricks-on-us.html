Whether or not it evokes a feeling of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fanged CW vampires</a>, the WandaVision spin-off is now formally titled Darkhold Diaries, but the latest rumors floating around on the internet suggest it might not stop there.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>If you recall, the very first title attached to the Disney Plus series was Agatha: House of Harkness. That was eventually changed to Coven of Chaos, but now the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">latest gossip on the playground</a> (otherwise known as X, or just Twitter for those who hate Elon Musk) suggests that the original title will become the name of one of the show’s episodes. Said episode is rumored to delve into Agatha’s past marriage to Rio Vidal and offer a glimpse of Agatha’s mother, Evanora Harkness.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Agatha-Darkhold-Diaries-Marvel-Disney-Plus.png><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>Rio Vidal is rumored to be played by Aubrey Plaza, a new character created specifically for the show. In addition to fueling the fire that Marvel is playing tricks on us with these name changes, the update reinforces those rumors that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Agatha will be bisexual</a>. This is the first mention of a marriage between Agatha and Rio Vidal. Previously, they were just rumored to be in a “relationship.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>Moreover, should House of Harkness indeed become an episode title, we wouldn’t be surprised if Coven of Chaos and Darkhold Diaries follow suit. Let’s not forget, Joe Locke once posted a photo from the set of a chairback with the title <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Agnes of Westview</a> and Aubrey Plaza <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">did the same with Darkhold Diaries</a> long before the latter became official. That means there have been a total of four titles attached to the show in one way or another, which is suspicious no matter which way you spin it.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>Indeed, it all feeds into the idea that Marvel knows exactly what it’s doing, and all this quote-unquote indecision is just a smoke screen for unveiling individual episodes of the show. It’s a bold move, to be sure — and right now it’s nothing but a rumor — but when it comes to Agatha you either go bold or go home.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=false>Agatha: House of Harkness, er, Coven of Chaos, er Darkhold Diaries‘ new release window puts it sometime in late 2024, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">just in time for spooky season</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yis8Ctn5pllJa%2FrLTOpZtmnJmWv6qx0maprqWfp7KledOoZKudo6q%2Fs7HCrWSaZZSarqV506KrpZ1dnsBustSrq6GdomK9s7vOn2StoJGpeq6t0a%2BcpWWZqHqxuMCyoKefXam%2Fqq%2FKrGSopl2qwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
