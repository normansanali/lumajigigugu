A video of herself enthusiastically using the n-word couldn’t refresh her memory as she ‘was given a sedative at the time of the video.’&nbsp;“I have zero recollection of the video and the disturbing language used during it,”&nbsp;Michelle told&nbsp;The Current.</p><p>Michelle acknowledged that the video was recorded in her home and apologized for it. Dane Ciolino, Michelle’s attorney, later told&nbsp;CBS News&nbsp;that one of the voices in the video belonged to her.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s unclear who else used a racial slur in the video, but rumor suggests that the voices belong to Michelle’s family.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=michelle-denied-that-she-and-her-husband-kenneth-odinet-jr-are-racist></span>Michelle denied that she and her husband, Kenneth Odinet Jr., are racist<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Michelle and her husband, Kenneth Odinet, have been married for nearly three decades. They have four children: Caroline, Libby, Elli, and Kenny.&nbsp;</p><p>The vile video recorded at Michelle and Kenneth’s house allegedly involves family members. So far, only Michelle has accepted that her voice is in the video.</p><p>A female voice repeatedly used the n-word and referred to the black man as a ‘roach.’ A male voice, saying that ‘mom’ was yelling the n-word, contributed to the seemingly funny conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>Is one of the male voices of Michelle’s son or husband? The names Ken and Kenny surface twice in the video, referring to someone who was ‘just standing there.’&nbsp;</p><p>The Odinet household has two potential ‘Kens’: Michelle’s husband, Kenneth Odinet, or her son, Kenny.</p><p>At the moment, we can’t confirm the identity of ‘Ken’ or ‘Kenny’ in the video.&nbsp;</p><p>Michelle has, however, insisted that she and her husband are not racist. She told&nbsp;The Current:</p><p>“Anyone who knows me and my husband knows this is contrary to the way we live our lives. I am deeply sorry and ask for your forgiveness and understanding as my family and I deal with the emotional aftermath of this armed burglary.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kenneth-odinet-is-a-plastic-surgeon-and-coroner-of-lafayette-parish></span>Kenneth Odinet is a plastic surgeon and coroner of Lafayette Parish<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kenneth Odinet is a South Louisiana native who received his medical degree from Louisiana State University in the late 80s.
