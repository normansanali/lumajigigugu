His contributions over the years have helped shape the way that hip hop is today, for better or for worse. However, his lyricism and overall ability to string together words are untouched. For many rappers that have emerged over the past seven or eight years, it's common for them to list Wayne as one of the greatest to ever do it. Today, the rapper shares his list for the five GOATs in hip hop.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Lil Wayne recently spoke to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Complex</a> earlier today to share his top five rappers of all time. The rapper's list consists of some heavyweights from the South and the east coast. Among them are Cam'ron, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>UGK</a>, 8 Ball & <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>MJG</a>, Missy Elliot and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a>. Considering Wayne's versatility as an emcee, his top five of all time doesn't come as a shock as each person on this list has carried their unique swag, both through their sonics and aesthetics.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Aside from his list, the rapper recently sparked some controversy over the weekend. During his headlining gig at High Times Cannabis Cup on Sunday, the rapper threatened to call on his "shooters" after people through stuff on stage. Interestingly enough, this marks the second time he's been less than content with his performance at the Cannabis Cup. The rapper was tapped to perform during the 2016 event and had a fit on stage because the people in the crowd were stoned and not as responsive as he'd like them to be.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
