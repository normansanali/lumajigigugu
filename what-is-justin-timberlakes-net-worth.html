Married to Jessica Biel since 2012, the pair have two children together, and they also do philanthropy work together, giving back to several causes important to their hearts. Biel and Timberlake have two sons who they raise out of the public eye, giving their family a break from the media presence surrounding them in their business ventures.</p><h2 id=h-is-timberlake-the-wealthiest-member-of-nsync data-injectable=false><strong>Is Timberlake the Wealthiest Member of NSYNC?</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=810 data-injectable=true>Timberlake is the wealthiest member of *NSYNC, with the most lengthy and full career in entertainment after the band went their separate ways. That’s not to say that his bandmates turned friends and family aren’t doing quite well for themselves either. Lance Bass, who has stayed in the entertainment industry as a significant presence, is worth $22 million, with JC Chasez following at $16 million. Chris Kirkpatrick is worth $10 million, with Joey Fatone sitting at $7 million for his net worth.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>Call us dreamers or fans with far too much hope for a future; that could all change if *NSYNC decides to stop tearin’ up our hearts and get back together for a tour in the future, or at least a new Christmas album!
