Hence, you should keep the following factors in mind when buying one.</span></p><h4><span>Material of the comb</span></h4><p><span>Most rat tail combs are made from plastic for the comb head and metal for the rat tail. Although plastic can cause static, it is a good option for people looking to tease hair. Rubber rat tail combs are more popular for detangling as they are more gentle on the hair. You can use wooden detangling combs if you have thick hair that does not work well with plastic.</span></p><h4><span>Length of the tail</span></h4><p><span>The length of the tail is significant for some styling techniques, as the tail also acts as a handle for the comb. Usually, longer tails make it easier to section and part the hair. They also easily lift a hair section when dyeing the hair.</span></p><h4><span>Type of bristles</span></h4><p><span>Rat tail combs usually have fine bristles that are very close to each other. This design helps users detangle hair to make it smooth. For curly and kinky hair, however, rat tail combs come with bristles that have a wider gap between the teeth. This is very useful for sectioning curly hair. You can also try using a comb with metal bristles to cut or trim curly hair.</span></p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=#>Best Detangling Sprays</a> for Hair Knots</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwvMSrqqimkaF6pK3RnmarmaRiwaK1y2aaqKWSZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
