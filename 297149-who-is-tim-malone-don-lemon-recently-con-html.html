Previously, the veteran broadcaster deeply desired to have a lifetime partner someday.</p><p class=dh>Lemon famously got drunk during his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/don-lemon-new-years-eve-piercing_n_5868b4bfe4b0eb586489d408>live CNN coverage</a> with fellow anchor Brooke Baldwin on New Year's Eve in 2017, and during that special broadcast, he announced that he was ready to be in a relationship with someone else.</p><p class=dh>Lemon also spoke about his desire to strike a healthy balance between his work and his personal life. The "CNN" star admitted he was the wrong person to date because he was too focused on himself.</p><p class=dh>He eventually met Malone, and the pair started dating in late 2017. The duo was even spotted <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://people.com/tv/don-lemon-leaves-snl-afterparty-walking-hand-in-hand-with-boyfriend-tim-malone/>holding hands</a> in public after attending a "Saturday Night Live" party at a nightclub in New York.</p><p class=dh>Lemon has never been shy about their relationship or feelings for one another since they met. During CNN's 2018 New Year's Eve coverage at a bar, the journalist and his handsome boyfriend <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/don-lemon-kisses-boyfriend-new-years-cnn/>kissed</a> live on air.</p><p class=dh>Many of Lemon's avid fans were speechless by the on-screen kiss, and some even wondered where they first met. Later, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/donlemon/status/947722907144343552>clarified</a> on Twitter that he met Malone in New York, not at the bar.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>When Are Don Lemon and Tim Malone Getting Married?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In April 2019, Lemon announced that he and Malone were officially engaged. The seasoned TV presenter shared a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv7QBh8BCjU/>photo</a> of their two dogs wearing separate tags with Malone's sweet marriage proposal on Instagram.</p><p class=dh>The memorable proposal with their pets came after Malone celebrated his birthday. Lemon also showed off their beautiful silver <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/entertainment/don-lemon-engaged-tim-malone>engagement rings</a> aside from the personalized dog accessories.</p><p class=dh>Since the couple announced their engagement, Lemon's friends and followers have congratulated and expressed excitement for the couple's new chapter.</p><p class=dh>Inquiries about the couple's upcoming wedding date also flooded in. Despite the pressure from fans to reveal more wedding details, Lemon stated that he and Malone were not in a rush to marry, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/don-lemon-no-rush-to-set-wedding-date/>adding</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I'm just trying to enjoy this moment of bliss. And then, whenever we get married, we get married."</p><p class=dh>However, three years after they announced their engagement, Lemon revealed in 2021 that he and his fiancé had decided to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/don-lemon-says-wedding-to-fiance-is-on-hold-until-after-covid/>postpone their wedding</a> due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p class=dh>Lemon assured them that the wedding would go ahead as planned, but they chose not to discuss their big day because there were more pressing matters to attend to, including the global health crisis.</p><p class=dh>Lemon and his fiancé were those affected by the pandemic who quarantined and worked from home. He also mentioned that they had recently moved into a larger home after living in a small space for a long time.</p><p class=dh>In addition to postponing their wedding, Lemon candidly revealed his plans to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/don-lemon-thinking-about-starting-family-fiance-tim-malone/>start a family</a> with Malone. They have been looking into alternative ways of having children, such as <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp0Tgwci0X0">adoption or surrogacy</a>.</p><p class=dh>Lemon also reflected on the beautiful relationship he shared with Malone, despite the challenges and adjustments they went through as a pair. Lemon said he found the perfect partner in someone who believes in unconditional love.</p><p class=dh>Growing up, Lemon said he thought he would never marry or have children and would never be honest with his family or the public about his true self. Lemon is now in a place where he can finally do all of these things with his fiancé.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Lemon previously revealed that he and his mother, Katherine Clark, had a tense relationship due to his sexual orientation.</strong></h3><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>What Has Don Lemon Said about His Sexuality?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Despite his fear of disclosing his true identity, Lemon came out as gay in 2011 through his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/16/business/media/16anchor.html>memoir</a> "Transparent." The book chronicles his struggles before becoming one of the most successful African-American journalists today.</p><p class=dh>The celebrated broadcaster shared about his life in his hometown of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://gaycitynews.com/don-lemon-and-tim-malone-open-up-about-their-relationship/>described</a> his difficult situation then as "two-fold" because he was a Black and gay man.</p><p class=dh>The community that he was in was quite traditional and conservative. Because homosexuality was taboo in the Black culture back then, Lemon said they were told to grow up as a man and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/16/business/media/16anchor.html>embrace masculinity</a>. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/16/business/media/16anchor.html>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"In the black community, they think you can pray the gay away."</p><p class=dh>Lemon explained that while most men follow the tradition of marrying someone of the opposite sex, some keep their sexual orientation hidden, and the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://gaycitynews.com/don-lemon-and-tim-malone-open-up-about-their-relationship/>term</a> "roommate" was used to refer to their partners.</p><p class=dh>In the end, Lemon moved to New York so that he could live and speak his mind freely. He never looked back at his hometown. Since then, his personal life, romantic life, and career in the Big Apple have flourished.</p><p class=dh>Lemon previously revealed that he and his mother, Katherine Clark, had a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.suggest.com/don-lemon-husband/188694/>tense relationship</a> due to his sexual orientation. He said she cried when he told his mother about his breakup with his ex-boyfriend in 1990.</p><p class=dh>Even though the mother-son relationship took some time to recover and heal, Lemon said his mother now accepts him for who he is. Clark has also learned details about her son's life and the people in his circle of friends.</p><p class=dh>Meanwhile, coming out was not a significant adjustment for Malone, but what changed was his life with the renowned broadcast journalist. Malone, who was used to living privately, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://gaycitynews.com/don-lemon-and-tim-malone-open-up-about-their-relationship/>admitted</a> that adjusting to Lemon's popularity took some time.</p><p class=dh>Aside from his various accomplishments on television, <a class="me a" href=#>Don Lemon</a> is also an <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/support/foundation/about/board/don-lemon.php>adjunct professor</a>, teaching curriculums related to new media at Brooklyn College, where he previously graduated with a degree in broadcast journalism.</p><p class=dh>Through life, Lemon and Malone continue to show that love has nothing to do with gender. Even though they haven't said much about their wedding plans, they can't wait to celebrate their beautiful nuptials with their loved ones as soon as the pandemic is over.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcGlkbnq4tM5moKxlpJ66brnApaannV2ZvK95y56kqKZdp7Kksc2to7Jlk6S7b7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
