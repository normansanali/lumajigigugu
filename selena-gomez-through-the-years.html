The Spring Breakers actress took to Instagram in April 2019 to <a href=#>open up about her decision</a> to put herself ahead of her career.</p><p>“I think that I needed a moment to myself because I do feel like I was growing and changing,” Gomez wrote before answering a fan’s question about the advice she’d give to her younger self.</p><p>“Gosh, if I knew what I know now,” she explained, “I am a believer of therapy. So, I think that I have had opportunities where I kind of reflect on the younger me, and I think that a lot of the times I wished that I could hug my younger self. I wish I could have done and experienced a lot of things, maybe, a little differently.”</p><p>She added: “I don’t really think people know my heart because I think that sometimes people may think that I politically say the right thing or I’m safe or I’ve been trained to speak this way. I don’t know how to be trained. Like, how on earth would someone be training me to speak things?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gomez has been a pioneer in her work to bring awareness to mental health as well as her career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Scroll down to take a look back at Selena Gomez through the years!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKa4xKeYZp%2BforK7edOhqaitl516tbTEZrCemaKofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
