As Dakota wrapped her arms around Elle in the photo, in the caption, she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq0g2qrrouR/ ">revealed</a>, "My confidante. My truth-teller. My person in all lifetimes. Being your sister is a dream. Happy birthday, angel. I love you the most."</p><p class=Fg>In the comments section, Elle showed her appreciation right back at her sister, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq0g2qrrouR/ ">commenting</a> on the post— which received over 200, 000 likes at the time of writing— "I love you the most." Elle also <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq1H464vBAM/>commemorated</a> making it "halfway to 50" with a trip down memory lane and revealed that one of her favorite things to do when she was younger was to play with her toy set, Sweet Street.</p><p class=Fg>And in the caption, she humorously shared that she was "25 going on 5" as her mother had "the genius idea" of getting her a cake that was modeled after the same toy set Elle had in storage and "executed it to perfection." <a class="Xd a" href=#>The actress</a> shared a side-by-side of the toy set and the cake that was nearly identical and<a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq1DmrQPf_M/> ended the caption</a> with, "It's always important to keep your childlike lens on life. I hold that little girl near to me as I get older always."</p><p class=Fg>After the Fanning family relocated to Los Angeles from Georgia, Dakota landed her first acting gig in a national Tide commercial in 2001, and her <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0266824/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">big break</a> came that same year. After her audition left the director and the rest of the crew blown away, Dakota landed a role in "I am Same," sharing the screen with<a class="Xd a" href=#> Sean Penn</a> and <a class="Xd a" href=#>Michelle Pfeiffer.</a></p><p class=Fg>Her sister's <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1102577/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">acting career </a>also blew up following "I am Sam," where Elle played the younger version of Dakota's character. The sisters appeared in the same film again, "Taken," in 2002, before Elle landed her first independent role of many in "Daddy's Day Care" the following year.</p><p class=Fg>During an interview<a class="Xd a" href=#>, Elle Fanning </a>revealed that<a class="Xd a" href=#> her sister's</a> career took off before hers and humorously shared that she used to be the "worst" when she would add fuel to the fire whenever Dakota would be recognized during her child star days. Now the sisters share <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-us/porter/article-cff55ad697ec1f28 ">an inseparable bond</a> and "balance each other in a very specific way."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1na29jZnquxYypnKurn6N6qrqMmqOlZZyes6bAyKacrGWUlriwwMBnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
