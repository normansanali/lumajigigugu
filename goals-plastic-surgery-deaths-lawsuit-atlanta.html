It has swiftly become one of the most recognizable plastic surgery firms due to exceptional client care, one-of-a-kind services, and health requirements that set them apart from the competition.</p><p>Many people undergo surgery to achieve their desired appearance. But have you heard of the deaths of people due to plastic surgery? The same has happened in recent years. Yes, that's true. Patients have died due to Goals Plastic Surgery in Atlanta, and now fans wonder about a detailed look at the death case and ongoing lawsuit.</p><p>Previously, we discussed the <a href=#><strong>plastic surgery</strong></a> efforts of <a href=#><strong>Madison Beer</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Mia Dio</strong></a>.</p><h2>Atlanta’s Goals Plastic Surgery Is Facing Lawsuits After the Deaths and Complications of Patients; Check Out the Reviews!</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Goals</a> Plastic Surgery (<a href=# rel=noopener>goalsplasticsurgery</a>)&nbsp;in Atlanta is preparing itself after learning that several of its patients plan to file lawsuits over alleged injuries and complications from Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) they claim they sustained as a result of procedures carried out at Goals.</p><p>Goals Plastic Surgery is a practice that offers patients a wide range of aesthetic operations, both invasive and non-invasive, to help them realize their goals, boost their confidence, and, quite honestly, improve their life.

The Goals team is currently organizing many significant community events that will provide a fantastic opportunity for both new and existing clients. However, numerous patients have been contacted to express their dissatisfaction with the Goals Plastic Surgery practice as a result of a death case and other problems, <a href=# rel=noopener>according</a> to Channel 2 Action News investigations. According to <strong>Witt</strong>;</p><p><strong>It takes a lot for me to take on a case, but upon review of these cases, we immediately saw a pattern of practice that had been going on for a while, and now we are seeing the result of many injured patients.</strong></p><p>According to 2017 Mofid research, 3 percent of the 692 surgeons polled had witnessed a patient's <a href=# rel=noopener>death</a> following surgery. The riskiest cosmetic treatment in the world, one in 3,000 BBLs resulted in death. Goals are also <a href=# rel=noopener>charged </a>with a lawsuit for trying to charge patients for a series of post-surgery massages, which are crucial for recuperation after the procedure but which plaintiffs claim Goals would collect the money for and then forego. Up to <strong>$1,000</strong> can be spent on a massage. Even a fatal case has been documented.</p><p><strong>Samantha Santana</strong>, one of the patients of Goals Plastic Surgery in Harlem, passed away a day after getting a BBL. She also struggled with self-esteem and image problems, which grew worse with the birth of her son, who is now 7 years old. <strong>Aliyah Santana</strong>, her sister, claimed that although her older sibling tried to lose weight by going to the gym and following diets, she was unsuccessful.</p><p>Then Santana discovered a miracle cure on Instagram: Goals Plastic Surgery, which has a facility in Harlem and an Instagram profile with 1.1 million followers featuring models with flawlessly rounded behinds after having a Brazilian butt lift.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/05/goals-plastic-surgery-deaths-lawsuit.jpg alt="Samantha, one of the patients at Goals Plastic Surgery in Harlem, died. celebsindepth.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong><span>Samantha</span>, one of the patients at Goals Plastic Surgery in Harlem, died.<br></strong><strong>Source: New York Post</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Samantha paid a deposit for the procedure and spent months researching the doctor, despite her family's concerns. Her goals coordinator informed her that her BMI was too high before the treatment. A steep ultimatum was presented to her. On the morning of September 23, 2020, Santana, who had lost around <strong>ten pounds</strong> in just two weeks, arrived at the spot on West 135th Street prepared to begin her new life. She died at Jack D. Weiler Hospital the following morning. A hazardous mixture of oxycodone, alprazolam (Xanax), lidocaine, and fentanyl was determined to be the cause of death.</p><p>As per the <a href=# rel=noopener>investigation</a>, the majority of individuals visit Goals for just one distinct operation. According to <strong>Dr. Pradeep Sinha</strong>, the founder of the Atlanta Institute for Goals Aesthetic Surgery, it is one of the riskiest operations ever. A serious problem, which includes death, affects one in 300 people.
