This was after his wife had come to visit him in London and had returned home.</p><p>At first, Kane only announced the cancellation of one show in Berlin, taking to his Instagram Story to explain why the show couldn't happen.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>‚ÄúHey Berlin ‚Äî I‚Äôm so sorry to do this at such late notice but unfortunately we have to cancel tonight‚Äôs show,‚Äù Kane wrote at the time. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been sick the last few days and have tried to power through. After seeing 2 doctors we had to make the difficult decision to cancel.‚Äù</p><p>As his message makes abundantly clear, Kane's decision to cancel the show wasn't one he wanted to make. In separate posts, he said that he had a 103 degree fever and that his sickness had brought him "to tears."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Kane seemed hopeful that he could recover in time to perform in Stockholm, which was scheduled to be the final stop on his tour, it wasn't meant to be.</p><p>‚ÄúStockholm ‚Äî Unfortunately, we have to cancel tomorrow night‚Äôs show," Kane posted on his story.

Fortunately, it seems that whatever his symptoms were, he has largely recovered from them.</p><p>After returning home to his family, Kane posted a video of a dance party with his family alongside the caption "Safe to say daddy is feeling way better ü§£ Morning dance party!!!!!" Since then, he even performed before the Super Bowl.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kane seems to have burned his hand more recently.</h2><p>After recovering from his tour illness, Kane posted a photo just this morning that seemed to show a fairly major chemical burn on his hand and up his arm.</p><p>"Worst pain ever!!!!!!!!" he wrote in the caption under the post, as his fans offered suggestions on how he could treat the burn. The burn did look quite severe, but Kane didn't offer any indication as to how he got it.</p><p>Even as some fans offered treatment tips, though, others were skeptical about whether the burn was actually real, in part because his sleeve seemed to be touching it. While some speculated that it might be makeup for a video or movie, others were positive that it was fake but offered no suggestion as to why. Either way, here's hoping it doesn't impact his next tour.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoK6vsYybqaivnmK1pq3LrZ8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
