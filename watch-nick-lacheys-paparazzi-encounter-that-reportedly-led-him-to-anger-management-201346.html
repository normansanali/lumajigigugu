In an interview with Daily Mail, which was first to report the news, Santos explained what led to the heated altercation."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He then started punching the window. I thought he was going to break his hand, that's how hard he was hitting the glass. I am surprised he didn't shatter the window."</span></p><p><span>In the video of the incident, taken from down the street, Lachey is not seen actually hitting the window. However,&nbsp;he can be seen trying to reach in and snatch the photographer's cellphone, with which she was also recording the encounter from inside the car.</span></p><p><span>In a video&nbsp;obtained by ET, Santos was interviewed on the scene of the incident and explained, "As he was walking away, I rolled my window down and grabbed my cellphone, started filming him, asked, 'Why did you punch my window, what's going on?' And then he made a big ruckus."</span></p><p><span>She also claimed to have smelled alcohol on his breath and can be heard telling Lachey, "I think your're drunk," as he stuck his tongue out mockingly and walked away from her car.</span></p><p><a href=# rel>At the time, Lachey took to Twitter</a><span>, where he admitted he "overreacted" but denied getting physical with the photographer.</span></p><p><span>"Last night, after enjoying a great dinner with my wife and our dear friend, the paparazzi harassed us as we walked back to our hotel. I clearly overreacted," Lachey wrote at the time.&nbsp;"I've been in this game long enough to know that their antics are sadly part of the deal. Stupid of me. Done. However, for </span><span>TMZ </span><span>or anyone else to say that I was violent or that I 'got physical' with someone is reckless and absolutely false."</span></p><p><span>In a statement to ET,</span><a href=# rel> the Los Angeles District attorney explained</a><span>, "Mr. Lachey has not been charged with misdemeanor assault and battery. Instead, he is participating in LADA’s Prefiling Diversion program which was established in 2017. As part of these conditions, he must participate in anger management classes and attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Successful completion of the Prefiling Diversion Program will result in no criminal charges being filed."</span></p><p><strong><span>RELATED CONTENT:</span></strong></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Nick Lachey Ordered to Attend Anger Management and AA Meetings</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Nick Lachey Makes Apparent Dig at Jessica Simpson on 'Love Is Blind'</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Nick Lachey Says He 'Overreacted' to Paparazzi, Talks 'False' Claims</span></h3></a><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7psDOp6OippVjsLC5jrCYrZuYYruqr8pmo5qbmJrGtHnPmqeaqpGvx6p5xKeaqK2eqbKzedOhmK1lopq9sL7TnpulsV2hsqV5x6KkZqyfYq6vs8SrZKaZnpa0prnEp6tmamBmgHWC</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
