Apart from appearing in movies, Bolo was a successful bodybuilder, as he held the Mr. Hong Kong body-building championship for ten years, which certainly increased is net worth as well.</p><h3>Bolo Yeung Net Worth $1.5 Million</h3><p>Lured by martial arts from a young age, it was only a matter of time before the young Bolo join a martial arts club, actually when he was 10 years old. He started to work with several kung fu masters, however, as he became older, his interest switched to bodybuilding. Little by little his career improved, and he became the Mr. Hong Kong bodybuilding champion, largely increasing his net worth.</p><p>Thanks partly to his good looks, he ventured into the entertainment industry, firstly appearing in commercials; while filming the commercial for Winston cigarettes, he met and befriended<a href=#> Bruce Lee</a>, and their friendship soon extended to professional collaboration for the film “Enter The Dragon” (1973), in which Bolo portrayed the role of Bolo, adopting the pseudonym.
