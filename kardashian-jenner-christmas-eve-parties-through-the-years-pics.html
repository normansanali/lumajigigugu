It was just the best night ever,” the Selfish author said in a confessional. “But my mom’s been doing it for so long that it’s turned into something different. It’s kind of a party just for my mom and mostly her friends. We want it to be a place that we can just have fun and it’s all of our friends and definitely family and my mom’s friends, too. But a good mix of both so we can have a good time and really just enjoy each other.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>From Kim reuniting with <a href=#><strong>Paris Hilton</strong></a> one year, to <a href=#>North</a> meeting Santa Claus, the bash is <a href=#>always a memorable one for lucky guests</a>.
