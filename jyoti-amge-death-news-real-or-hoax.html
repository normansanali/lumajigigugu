She is now 30 years old and continues to inspire people worldwide.</p><p>Amge comes from a loving family with her parents, Kishanji Amge and Ranjana Amge. Her elder brother is Satish Amge, and her three elder sisters are Vaishali Amge, Rupali Amge, and Archana Amge.</p><p>Her family has been an incredible source of support and encouragement for Jyoti throughout her life.</p><p>On her 18th birthday in 2011, Jyoti was officially declared the world’s shortest woman by Guinness World Records. She stands at a height of only 62.8 centimeters (2 ft 0.72 in).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Downloader.la-6451d2353e667.jpg><p>This achievement brought her international recognition and opened doors for her to share her inspiring story.</p><p>In 2012, Jyoti had the opportunity to meet the world’s shortest man, Chandra Bahadur Dangi of Nepal.

Her restricted height is attributed to a genetic disorder known as primordial dwarfism, a rare condition that affects growth and development.</p><p>Specifically, she has achondroplasia, a type of primordial dwarfism that inhibits hormone production, causing her height and weight to remain constant throughout her life.</p><p>Jyoti’s journey to global recognition began in 2009 when she appeared on a popular television show called “Bikkuri Chojin 100 Special No.2,” where doctors measured her and officially declared her the shortest living teenager (female) at just 61.95 cm (2 ft) tall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Downloader.la-6451d2aeafd4a.jpg><p>Even more remarkable was her weight of only 5.4 kg (12 lb), just 4 kg (9 lb) more than her birth weight.</p><p>Despite her unique physical condition, Jyoti has always been determined to lead an everyday life. When she was four, she went to school with regular-sized children, but her desk and chair were made to fit her smaller size.</p><p>Her story has inspired people worldwide, demonstrating that differences in physical appearance need not limit one’s ability to live a fulfilling life.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=#>Yasin Cengiz Death News Real Or Hoax?
