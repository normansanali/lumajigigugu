Before the 2023 season, Carolina hired Frank Reich, another quarterback specialist, to coach their top draft pick. However, Reich lasted only 11 games, and the club only won once.
So the Panthers went back to the beginning and picked Canales, the Buccaneers’ offensive coordinator."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, Reich lasted only 11 games, and the club only won once.</p><p style=text-align:justify>So the Panthers went back to the beginning and picked Canales, the Buccaneers’ offensive coordinator. He is the 10th head coach in the team’s history.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Following a trade with the Bears, the Panthers selected Bryce Young first overall in the 2023 NFL draft. Young had a challenging debut season, appearing in 16 games and completing 59.8% of his throws for 2,877 yards. The squad only won two of seventeen games, and the Bears received the first pick in the 2024 draft.</p><p style=text-align:justify>According to Mike Garafolo of NFL Network, Canales’ appointment as head coach is rather surprising. He was the offensive coordinator for only one season in Tampa after spending 13 years with the Seahawks in various positions.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Because of all of these developments, many people want to learn more about him, which is exactly what we will do in this post.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Dave Canales Ethnicity</h2><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Dave Canales, a Mexican-American, is now the Panthers’ second Latino head coach, following Rivera</strong>. His grandparents, Miguel and Lupe, immigrated from Mexico to the United States in the 1990s. His grandfather even established a church that originally spoke Spanish.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Dave-Canales-Ethnicity-1.jpg><p style=text-align:justify>Today, the church has over 3,000 members and holds services in both Spanish and English. During the 2023–2024 NFL season, Canales was the sole offensive coordinator with Latin American or Hispanic roots.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The new Panthers head coach stated at the outset of the season, “I feel proud of being Mexican-American.” That’s something unique about him.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Dave Canales Partner</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Lizzy Canales is a writer, speaker, and wife of the Carolina Panthers head coach, Dave Canales. She participated in a variety of sports throughout high school and college, earning numerous honors.</p><p style=text-align:justify>She is very interested in health education, particularly nutrition, and she enjoys hiking and watching nature. Lizzy holds a master’s degree in secondary health education, according to Black Stone Publishing.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Lizzy and Dave originally met in Azusa Pacific. They became friends and began messaging each other when Lizzy went away for a semester. When she returned to the US, Dave asked her out, and the rest is history.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The Canales family has four children: Ashby, Benjamin, Beatrice, and Amaya. When Dave was the offensive coordinator for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Lizzy and the kids would frequently attend his home games.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Dave Canales Net Worth</h2><p>Dave Canales is the next head coach of the Carolina Panthers, and the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator will take over a club with enormous potential. Panthers owner David Tepper chose Canales to take over the team with the worst record in the 2023 regular season, and he expects results soon.</p><p><strong>Canales is a very new head coach; hence, his net worth is unknown. Most net-worth tracking sites estimate his fortune at between $2 million and $5 million.</strong> According to Sports Monetize, the average annual salary for an NFL assistant coach is $400,000 per season.</p><p><strong>You can also check out our posts below related to other stars’ ethnicities:</strong></p><ul style=text-align:justify><li style=text-align:justify><a href=# rel=noopener>Charly Arnolt Ethnicity: The Versatile Sports Personality with a Diverse Background</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Isiah Pacheco Ethnicity: Exploring the Cultural Mix That Shapes His Identity and Success</a></li></ul><p style=text-align:justify>For more information related to other stars’ ethnicity, nationality, and background, you can <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>follow our Twitter account</a></strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX5mut7GMnJinmZyawG6x06GlopuZqcZwgpFubmln</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
