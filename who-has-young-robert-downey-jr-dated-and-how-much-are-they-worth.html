However, like most people, Downey Jr. got involved with several other people before he found his current spouse. When looking back at Downey Jr.’s love life, it is interesting to compare the net worths of the women he has been involved with.</p><h2 id=jennifer-jason-leigh-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-5-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jennifer Jason Leigh’s Net Worth Is $5 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the years since he rose to fame, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Downey Jr. has been involved with several women</a> including the first star he is known to have dated, Jennifer Jason Leigh.

For example, Downey Jr.’s love life has been the subject of gossip including rumors that he briefly dated Winona Ryder in 1991. At the height of Ryder’s career, she was in the running for almost every highly sought-after role that was to be played by a young woman. After becoming a major movie star, Ryder’s career went on a downhill slide for several years but once Stranger Things became a sensation, it rebounded. As a result of her immense acting talent and having a will strong enough to weather Hollywood for years, Ryder is worth $18 million according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=susan-downey-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-20-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Susan Downey’s Net Worth Is $20 Million</span></h2><p>A few years after Robert Downey Jr. gained notoriety, he married a woman named Deborah Falconer but there are no reliable accounts of her current net worth. On the other hand, a lot more is known about the actor’s second and current wife, Susan Downey. The former co-president of Dark Castle Entertainment and executive vice president of production at Silver Pictures, Susan has always been a formidable person. Currently the co-founder and co-president of the production company Team Downey, Susan is set to continue influencing the film industry for many years to come.

For people unfamiliar with the actors’ history, that may have seemed unremarkable since Stark is a character who flirts with every attractive woman. Given the fact that Downey Jr. and Tomei briefly dated in 1993, however, flirting on camera must have felt like déjà vu. A truly talented actor, Tomei has starred in many highly successful films including the Spider-Man movies, My Cousin Vinny, and Crazy, Stupid, Love. After surviving in Hollywood for decades, Tomei is worth $25 million according to celebritynetworth.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Really Happened Between Marisa Tomei And Robert Downey Jr?</a></span></p><h2 id=calista-flockhart-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-30-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Calista Flockhart’s Net Worth IS $30 Million</span></h2><p>Just like Winona Ryder, it has never been confirmed that Calista Flockhart dated Robert Downey Jr. as their time together has only been rumored. However, it is known that from 1997 until 2002 Flockhart starred in one of the most talked-about shows on television, Ally McBeal. As fans of the show will no doubt remember, Ally McBeal gave Robert Downey Jr. the chance to prove that he could still light up a screen following a stint in prison. On top of headlining Ally McBeal, Flockhart has also starred in shows like Brothers & Sisters as well as Supergirl in the past. Thanks to her roles in those shows and appearing in several movies, Flockhart has a $30 million fortune according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sarah-jessica-parker-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-200-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sarah Jessica Parker’s Net Worth Is $200 Million</span></h2><p>At this point, Sarah Jessica Parker has been married to Matthew Broderick for roughly two and a half decades.
