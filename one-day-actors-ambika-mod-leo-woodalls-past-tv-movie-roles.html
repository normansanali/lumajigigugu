She’s also nabbed a few TV roles here and there including I Hate Suzie, Trying and The Mash Report.</p><p>Due to her lack of acting experience, Mod actually turned down her role in One Day when it was first offered to her.</p><p>“I just didn’t see myself in that role, to be honest,” she told <a href=#>Netflix Tudum</a> in February 2024. “It took well into the shoot for me to convince myself that it was the right call for me to be there doing that.”</p><p>As for Woodall, saying yes to the part was instant after a lengthy auditioning process — and was immediately followed by “a huge sigh of relief.”</p><p>“It’s just a beautiful, beautiful story, and it has this legacy already,” he told Tudum. “Both characters are so well-formed. There’s a huge [amount] of joyfulness.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Based on <strong>David Nicholls</strong>’ 2009 bestselling novel, One Day chronicles the decades-long slow-burn romance between Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew.
