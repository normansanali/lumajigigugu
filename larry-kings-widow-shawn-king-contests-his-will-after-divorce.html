Shawn, from whom Larry filed for divorce in August 2019, claimed in court documents obtained by Us Weekly on Tuesday, February 16, that she and the late talk show host “had gone to counseling, were still speaking, and reconciliation remained possible until Larry’s health conditions made that impractical.” She also alleged that their divorce “had been pending for quite some time” and that Larry “was generally nonresponsive and refused to participate in the divorce proceeding” before his death on January 23."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Shawn is the one with the most knowledge of Larry’s businesses, assets and wishes,” Shawn’s attorneys said in Tuesday’s court filing.</p><p>The lawyers pointed out that Larry Jr., 59, whom the Emmy winner shared with his second wife, Annette Kaye, did not have any relationship with his father until his 30s.</p><p>“[Larry Jr.] has never been involved in Larry’s career or business,” Shawn’s attorneys said, calling it “highly inappropriate to place him in a position of representing Larry’s estate.”</p><p>Prior to going to court, Shawn told the New York Post’s <a href=#>Page Six</a> that she and Larry had drafted “a very watertight family estate plan” in 2015 “as a couple.” She added, “It still exists, and it is the legitimate will.”</p><p>Us previously obtained a will dated October 17, 2019, in which Larry wrote that he wanted “100% of my funds” to go to his kids. He noted that the legal document, which he signed nearly two months after filing for divorce from Shawn, “should replace all previous writings.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Larry died of sepsis at age 87 from after being <a href=#>hospitalized with COVID-19</a>. He is survived by Larry Jr. and his two sons with Shawn: Chance, 21, and Cannon, 20. His children Andy and Chaia, whom he shared with his third wife, Alene Akins, <a href=#>died within three weeks of each other</a> in the summer of 2020. Andy and Chaia were 65 and 51, respectively.</p><p>With reporting by Marjorie Hernandez</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmaKnxm63yKeerGWnnrGww4ysn5qvnmK4qrrGZpqopqSawLW%2FjKGgrGWnnrmtecCfq56qXZm2t7vRnJxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
