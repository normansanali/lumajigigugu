Such a cute way to find out our [baby’s] gender. PS —— you def want to wait til the end. 😜,” Franzel, 28, captioned the footage. In the video, she shook up a canister, closed her eyes and sprayed a puff of whipped cream that was dyed blue to signify that she and Arroyo, 29, are expecting a boy. The newlyweds proceeded to smear the sweet treat all over each other’s faces.</p><p>The couple first met during season 18 of Big Brother in 2016 and began dating a year later. He proposed during a joint appearance on the CBS reality show in 2018, and the pair tied the knot in Winter Park, Florida, on Tuesday, March 16.</p><p>“It feels amazing! We’ve been waiting for this moment for so long and it’s finally happened,” the season 18 winner and her husband told Us Weekly exclusively following the wedding. “All the stress of having a wedding is lifted off our shoulders. Now all our attention is focused on having a healthy and happy baby.”</p><p>The duo, who married at the Casa Feliz Historic Home & Venue, had planned to wed in mid-2020 but had to <a href=#>push the ceremony back</a> due to the coronavirus pandemic. They then planned a December 2020 ceremony in Turks and Caicos but <a href=#>had to reschedule a second time</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nicole-Franzel-Victor-Arroyo-Reveal-Sex-First-Baby-Promo.jpg><p>In January 2021, the reality stars announced <a href=#>they’re expecting their first child</a>.
