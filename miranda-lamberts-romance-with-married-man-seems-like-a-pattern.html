Biggest Celebrity Cheating Scandals Ever!
Though she and Evan Felker, both 34, have been seeing each other since February, their romance first ignited while she was still with then-boyfriend Anderson East. At the time, the Turnpike Troubadours frontman had also just initiated divorce proceedings from his now-estranged wife, Staci.
“Miranda knew Evan was married but that didn’t stop either of them,” an insider reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Just months after her 2015 split from her husband of four years, <a href=#><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a>, Lambert had already moved on with East, 29. (Fueling rumors that infidelity caused their shocking breakup, in 2016 Shelton released “She’s Got a Way With Words,” which takes aim at a philandering ex.)</p><p><a href=#>Celebrity Split 2018</a></p><p class=p1><a href=#>And before she burned Shelton</a>, 41, Lambert had broken the heart of then-love <a href=#>Jeff Allen — who called out her wandering eye in an April 26 tweet</a>.</p><p class=p1>“It seems like this is a pattern for her,” explains a second source — one others have picked up on too.

An open book, the two-time Grammy winner has often been praised for folding her real-life drama into her music. Case in point: While accepting her ACM award for Best Song on April 15, she applauded her fans for sticking by her through misery, saying in her speech, “Thank you guys so much for sharing my broken heart with me.” (Shelton and girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong> </a>were also in attendance<a href=#> at the event</a>.)</p><p><a href=#>Celebrity Couples Who Stayed Together After Cheating Scandals</a></p><p class=p1>Though the public once sided with her, the tide seems to be turning. After news broke of her dalliance with Felker, social media users began leaving scathing comments on her posts, demanding she “stay away from people’s husbands,” and “woman up and respect others and yourself.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Now her friends fear the vitriol could take a toll on her. “Miranda is insecure and has too many ‘yes’ people in her life,” reveals a source. “She does this to herself.
